26502412	Prevention of Lower Extremity Injuries in Basketball: A Systematic Review and	"CONTEXT: Lower extremity injuries are common in basketball, yet it is unclear how prophylactic interventions affect lower extremity injury incidence rates. OBJECTIVE:
To analyze the effectiveness of current lower extremity injury prevention programs
in basketball athletes, focusing on injury rates of (1) general lower extremity
injuries, (2) ankle sprains, and (3) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. DATA
SOURCES: PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and the Cochrane Register of
Controlled Trials were searched in January 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were
included if they were randomized controlled or prospective cohort trials, contained
a population of competitive basketball athletes, and reported lower extremity injury
incidence rates specific to basketball players. In total, 426 individual studies
were identified. Of these, 9 met the inclusion criteria. One other study was found
during a hand search of the literature, resulting in 10 total studies included in
this meta-analysis. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. LEVEL OF
EVIDENCE: Level 2. DATA EXTRACTION: Details of the intervention (eg, neuromuscular
vs external support), size of control and intervention groups, and number of
injuries in each group were extracted from each study. Injury data were classified
into 3 groups based on the anatomic diagnosis reported (general lower extremity
injury, ankle sprain, ACL rupture). RESULTS: Meta-analyses were performed
independently for each injury classification. Results indicate that prophylactic
programs significantly reduced the incidence of general lower extremity injuries
(odds ratio [OR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57-0.85; P < 0.001) and ankle sprains (OR, 0.45;
95% CI, 0.29-0.69; P < 0.001), yet not ACL ruptures (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.36-3.29; P
= 0.87) in basketball athletes. CONCLUSION: In basketball players, prophylactic
programs may be effective in reducing the risk of general lower extremity injuries
and ankle sprains, yet not ACL injuries.

26512912	Evidence-based post-exercise recovery strategies in basketball.	"Basketball can be described as a moderate-to-long duration exercise including repeated bouts of high-intensity activity interspersed with periods of low to
moderate active recovery or passive rest. A match is characterized by repeated
explosive activities, such as sprints, jumps, shuffles and rapid changes in
direction. In top-level modern basketball, players are frequently required to play
consecutive matches with limited time to recover. To ensure adequate recovery after
any basketball activity (i.e., match or training), it is necessary to know the type
of fatigue induced and, if possible, its underlying mechanisms. Despite limited
scientific evidence to support their effectiveness in facilitating optimal recovery,
certain recovery strategies are commonly utilized in basketball. It is particularly
important to optimize recovery because players spend a much greater proportion of
their time recovering than they do in training. Therefore, the main aim of this
report is to facilitate useful information that may lead to practical application,
based on the scientific evidence and applied knowledge specifically in basketball.

29401204	Power Testing in Basketball: Current Practice and Future Recommendations.	"Wen, N, Dalbo, VJ, Burgos, B, Pyne, DB, and Scanlan, AT. Power testing in basketball: Current practice and future recommendations. J Strength Cond Res 32(9):
2686-2700, 2018-Numerous foundational movements performed during basketball are
predicated on underlying power-related attributes, including speed,
change-of-direction (COD), and jumping. Accordingly, fitness testing batteries for
basketball have incorporated an assortment of linear speed tests, COD tests, and
jump tests. However, because of the wide variety of testing options, it is difficult
for basketball practitioners to select appropriate testing protocols for the
assessment of power-related attributes. As a result, there is a need to review the
relevant literature to identify game-specific, power-related attributes important in
basketball and the most appropriate tests available to assess power-related
attributes for basketball practitioners. Therefore, the aims of this review were to:
(a) identify essential power-related attributes important in basketball; (b) discuss
the suitability of common and novel power-related tests; and (c) provide
recommendations for future research and best practice approaches for basketball
coaching staff. In this review, we propose a series of novel tests that are more
targeted and specific to basketball movements including: (a) 5- and 10-m linear
sprints, (b) modified agility T-test, (c) change-of-direction deficit (CODD), (d)
lateral bound, (e) Sargent jump, (f) one-step jump, and (g) isometric midthigh pull
test. Improved testing of power-related attributes should enable basketball
practitioners to develop targeted training plans for enhancing player performance.

16247261	Basketball injuries.	"OBJECTIVE: To identify and quantify, to the best extent possible from the existing literature, injury characteristics and factors (risk; protective) associated with
injury in young basketball players. DATA SOURCES: Database searches principally
involving Medline and SportDiscus. In addition, web-based searching and filtering of
the reference lists of papers found in the preliminary searches were utilized. MAIN
RESULTS: Few well-controlled studies of this population have been conducted.
However, from the information available: basketball is the most frequent cause of
sports-related emergency department visits for youth and adolescents; the risk of
being injured in a game is greater than for practice; girls are more likely to be
injured than boys, especially with knee and ankle injuries and the knee injuries are
more likely to be severe; acute injuries are more common than chronic;
strains/sprains are the most common types of injuries but overall time loss is
minimal, indicating that the majority of pediatric basketball injuries are minor
(less than 7 days away from activity). Intervention studies show that: mouthguards
reduce orofacial/dental injuries; mouthguard use can be increased in young players;
neuromuscular training can reduce the incidence of knee injuries in female
participants; postural sway is related to risk of ankle injury. CONCLUSIONS: The
current state of epidemiological research involving youth and adolescent basketball
injuries is poor. With an increasing number of young participants, in situations
ranging from informal play and physical education classes to organized community and
school teams, the need for comprehensive and authoritative information on risk and
protective factors is significant.

29140908	Heart Rate Monitoring in Basketball: Applications, Player Responses, and Practical	"Berkelmans, DM, Dalbo, VJ, Kean, CO, Milanović, Z, Stojanović, E, Stojiljković, N, and Scanlan, AT. Heart rate monitoring in basketball: applications, player
responses, and practical recommendations. J Strength Cond Res 32(8): 2383-2399,
2018-The aims of this review were to collate the existing literature encompassing
heart rate (HR) monitoring in basketball to (a) identify the applications of HR
measurement; (b) report HR responses in male and female players during training and
game-play; (c) evaluate use of current HR-based training load models; and (d)
provide recommendations for future research and best practice approaches for
basketball practitioners. Heart rate monitoring in basketball carries 3 primary
applications: (a) monitoring exercise intensity; (b) assessing player fatigue
status; and (c) quantifying internal training load. When interpreting the available
training and game-play HR data in basketball players, key differences have been
observed between playing positions and playing levels. Sex- and age-based
differences in HR responses during basketball training and game-play are apparent
across separate studies; however, further research exploring HR responses in wider
player groups is needed, especially in female and junior players. There is also a
lack of research directly comparing player HR responses during training and
game-play to ascertain the effectiveness of different drills in preparing players
for competition. Heart rate-based models have been frequently used to quantify the
internal training load in basketball players, including Banister's Training Impulse
(TRIMP), Lucia's TRIMP, and Edwards' Summated-Heart-Rate-Zones (SHRZ). The SHRZ
model seems to hold practical advantages and better detect changes in player
responses across training cycles compared with other approaches. Practical outcomes
of this review center on recommendations for position-specific training plans,
drills to promote desired cardiovascular stress, analysis of HR outcome measures,
and ideal training load monitoring approaches.

30942645	Sport science applied to basketball refereeing: a narrative review.	"Objectives: The present review provides a summary of basketball referees' game activities, fitness assessment, cognitive function, and energy expenditure (EE)
during official games.Methods: Analyzing the literature on basketball referees.
Literature review conducted using Pub Med, WOK, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar, with
search criteria including the terms 'referees', 'game officials', 'basketball' and
performance terms such as 'physiological', 'physical demands', 'decision-making',
and 'mental fatigue'.Results: the relevant studies (n = 19) showed that referees
cover ~5000 m during a game with mean heart rates (HR) of ~140 beats.min(-1) (>75%
HR(max)) and oxygen uptake (VO(2)) of ~52 ml.min(-1).kg(-1) (~86.19% VO(2)max). The
YO-YO intermittent recovery test level 1 (YO-YO-IRT1) performance has revealed a
direct validity to assess the intermittent aerobic activity as it was correlated to
the on-field activity of the referees. The estimated referees' EE during a game
exceeds 500 kcal (~5 kcal.kg-1.h(-1)). The threshold of low intensity and high
intensity could be considered as lower than 3.8 METs and higher than 9.8 METs,
respectively. The physical abilities of referees decrease gradually with the
chronological age. However, older referees (>32 years old) have a significantly
better quality of officiating than young referees. The perceptual-cognitive demands
of basketball refereeing are also discussed in the present review.Conclusion:
Basketball referees' game-analysis showed an intermittent activity (~1:12 ratio of
high-intensity effort/recovery). The YO-YO-IRT1 could be used as a specific fitness
test to estimate their aerobic capacity. The referees' EE showed a ""moderate energy
intensity"" when expressed by the metabolic equivalent (~5 METs). A specific training
program should be prescribed for the referees, taking into consideration their age.
The cognitive processes influencing basketball referees' decisions should be studied
in further researches.

27364907	Injuries sustained in National Collegiate Athletic Association men's and women's	"BACKGROUND/AIM: Recent rule changes regarding the safety of basketball athletes necessitate up-to-date reports of injury incidence. This study describes the
epidemiology of injuries in men's and women's National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) basketball during the 2009/2010-2014/2015 seasons. METHODS:
Basketball injury data originate from the 2009/2010-2014/2015 academic years from
the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program (NCAA-ISP) from 78 men's and 74 women's NCAA
basketball programmes which provided 176 and 181 team-seasons, respectively. A
reportable injury occurred during organised practice or competition and required
attention from an athletic trainer (AT) or physician. Injury rates, injury
proportions and rate ratios (RRs) were calculated. All 95% CIs not containing 1.0
were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 2308 and 1631
injuries were reported in men's and women's basketball, respectively, for injury
rates of 7.97 and 6.54/1000 athlete-exposures (AEs). The rate was higher in men than
women (RR=1.22; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.30). Non-time-loss (NTL) injuries (resulting in
participation restriction time under 24 hours) accounted for 64.8% and 53.6% of
men's competition and practice injuries, respectively, and 53.9% and 51.3% of
women's competition and practice injuries, respectively. Injuries to the lower
extremity were the most common in competitions (men: 54.9%; women: 59.0%) and
practices (men: 62.4%; women: 67.3%). The most common injury in men's and women's
basketball was ankle sprain (17.9% and 16.6%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: NTL
injuries account for over half of all injuries in basketball. Most injuries were
lower extremity injuries, specifically ankle sprains. While rule changes have been
implemented to make basketball safer, continued research is needed to assess the
effectiveness of these changes.

28445227	A Review of Player Monitoring Approaches in Basketball: Current Trends and Future	"Fox, JL, Scanlan, AT, and Stanton, R. A review of player monitoring approaches in basketball: current trends and future directions. J Strength Cond Res 31(7):
2021-2029, 2017-Effective monitoring of players in team sports such as basketball
requires an understanding of the external demands and internal responses, as they
relate to training phases and competition. Monitoring of external demands and
internal responses allows coaching staff to determine the dose-response associated
with the imposed training load (TL), and subsequently, if players are adequately
prepared for competition. This review discusses measures reported in the literature
for monitoring the external demands and internal responses of basketball players
during training and competition. The external demands of training and competition
were primarily monitored using time-motion analysis, with limited use of
microtechnology being reported. Internal responses during training were typically
measured using hematological markers, heart rate, various TL models, and perceptual
responses such as rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Heart rate was the most
commonly reported indicator of internal responses during competition with limited
reporting of hematological markers or RPE. These findings show a large discrepancy
between the reporting of external and internal measures and training and competition
demands. Microsensors, however, may be a practical and convenient method of player
monitoring in basketball to overcome the limitations associated with current
approaches while allowing for external demands and internal responses to be recorded
simultaneously. The triaxial accelerometers of microsensors seem well suited for
basketball and warrant validation to definitively determine their place in the
monitoring of basketball players. Coaching staff should make use of this technology
by tracking individual player responses across the annual plan and using real-time
monitoring to minimize factors such as fatigue and injury risk.

26259551	Motor learning strategies in basketball players and its implications for ACL injury	"PURPOSE: Adding external focus of attention (EF, focus on the movement effect) may optimize current anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury prevention programmes. The
purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of an EF, by a visual
stimulus and an internal focus, by a verbal stimulus during unexpected sidestep
cutting in female and male athletes and how these effects remained over time.
METHODS: Ninety experienced basketball athletes performed sidestep cutting
manoeuvres in three sessions (S1, S2 and S3). In this randomized controlled trial,
athletes were allocated to three groups: visual (VIS), verbal (VER) and control
(CTRL). Kinematics and kinetics were collected at the time of peak knee frontal
plane moment. RESULTS: Males in the VIS group showed a larger vertical ground
reaction force (S1: 25.4 ± 3.1 N/kg, S2: 25.8 ± 2.9 N/kg, S3: 25.2 ± 3.2 N/kg) and
knee flexion moments (S1: -3.8 ± 0.9 Nm/kg, S2: -4.0 ± 1.2 Nm/kg, S3: -3.9 ± 1.3
Nm/kg) compared to the males in the VER and CTRL groups and to the females in the
VIS group (p < 0.05). Additionally, the males in the VIS group reduced knee valgus
moment and the females in the VER group reduced knee varus moment over time (n.s.).
CONCLUSION: Male subjects clearly benefit from visual feedback. Females may need
different feedback modes to learn a correct movement pattern. Sex-specific learning
preferences may have to be acknowledged in day by day practice. Adding video
instruction or feedback to regular training regimens when teaching athletes safe
movement patterns and providing individual feedback might target suboptimal
long-term results and optimize ACL injury prevention programmes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:

28449611	Return to play and performance after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in	"OBJECTIVES: To investigate return to play (RTP) and functional performance after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) in National Basketball Association
(NBA) players and to perform a systematic review of the literature to understand RTP
after ACLR in professional basketball. METHODS: NBA players undergoing ACLR between
2008 and 2014 by two surgeons were identified. RTP and performance were assessed
based on a review of publically available statistics. A systematic review of the
literature was performed using the MEDLINE database. Inclusion criteria were:
English language, ACL surgery outcome, professional basketball and RTP outcome. We
reviewed studies for RTP rates and RTP performance. RESULTS: Our study included 12
professional basketball players with NBA level experience. Eleven of the 12 players
returned to their prior level of play. Eight of the 9 (88.9%) players actively
playing in the NBA returned to play in the NBA at a mean 9.8 months. Among players
returning to NBA play, during RTP season 1, mean per game statistics decreased for
the following: minutes, points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers and
personal fouls - none of these changes reached statistical significance. Player
efficiency ratings significantly declined from pre-injury (12.5) to the first RTP
season (7.6) (p = 0.05). By RTP season 2, player performance metrics approximated
pre-injury levels and were not significantly different. Six studies met inclusion
criteria; reported RTP rates ranged from 78-86%. Identified studies similarly found
a decline in functional performance after RTP. CONCLUSION: There is a high rate
(89%) of return to NBA play for NBA players undergoing ACLR. After RTP, however,
there is a quantitative decline in initial season 1 RTP statistics with a
significant decrease in player efficiency rating. By RTP season 2, performance
metrics demonstrated an improvement compared to RTP season 1 but did not reach
pre-injury functional performance, though performance metrics are not significantly
different between pre-injury and RTP season 2.

11273971	Ankle injuries in basketball: injury rate and risk factors.	"OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of ankle injury and examine risk factors of ankle injuries in mainly recreational basketball players. METHODS: Injury observers sat
courtside to determine the occurrence of ankle injuries in basketball. Ankle injured
players and a group of non-injured basketball players completed a questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total of 10 393 basketball participations were observed and 40 ankle
injuries documented. A group of non-injured players formed the control group (n =
360). The rate of ankle injury was 3.85 per 1000 participations, with almost half
(45.9%) missing one week or more of competition and the most common mechanism being
landing (45%). Over half (56.8%) of the ankle injured basketball players did not
seek professional treatment. Three risk factors for ankle injury were identified:
(1) players with a history of ankle injury were almost five times more likely to
sustain an ankle injury (odds ratio (OR) 4.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.95 to
12.48); (2) players wearing shoes with air cells in the heel were 4.3 times more
likely to injure an ankle than those wearing shoes without air cells (OR 4.34, 95%
CI 1.51 to 12.40); (3) players who did not stretch before the game were 2.6 times
more likely to injure an ankle than players who did (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.01 to 6.34).
There was also a trend toward ankle tape decreasing the risk of ankle injury in
players with a history of ankle injury (p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Ankle injuries
occurred at a rate of 3.85 per 1000 participations. The three identified risk
factors, and landing, should all be considered when preventive strategies for ankle
injuries in basketball are being formulated.

30092009	Kinetics and perception of basketball landing in various heights and footwear	"BACKGROUND: The previous studies on basketball landing have not shown a systematic agreement between landing impacts and midsole densities. One plausible reason is
that the midsole densities alone used to represent the cushioning capability of a
shoe seems over simplified. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of
different landing heights and shoes of different cushioning performance on tibial
shock, impact loading and knee kinematics of basketball players. METHODS: Nineteen
university team basketball players performed drop landings from different height
conditions (0.45m vs. 0.61m) as well as with different shoe cushioning properties
(regular, better vs. best-cushioned). For each condition, tibial acceleration,
vertical ground reaction force and knee kinematics were measured with a tri-axial
accelerometer, force plate and motion capture system, respectively. Heel comfort
perception was indicated on the 150-mm Visual Analogue Scale. A 2 (height) x 3
(footwear) ANOVA with repeated measures was performed to determine the effects of
different landing heights and shoe cushioning on the measured parameters. RESULTS:
We did not find significant interactions between landing height and shoe conditions
on tibial shock, impact peak, mean loading rate, maximum knee flexion angle and
total ankle range of motion. However, greater tibial shock, impact peak, mean
loading rates and total ankle range of motion were determined at a higher landing
height (P < 0.01). Regular-cushioned shoes demonstrated significantly greater tibial
shock and mean loading rate compared with better- and best-cushioned shoes (P <
0.05). The correlation analysis indicated that the heel comfort perception was
fairly associated with impact peak and mean loading rate regardless of heights (P <
0.05), but not associated with tibial shock. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of shoe
cushioning performance, regardless of shoe midsole materials and constructions,
would be capable in order to identify optimal shoe models for better protection
against tibial stress fracture. Subjective comfort rating could estimate the level
of impact loading in non-laboratory based situations.

31703270	Hand Preference and Performance in Basketball Tasks.	"The aims of this study were to develop and validate an instrument to quantitatively assess the handedness of basketballers in basketball tasks (Basketball Handedness
Inventory, BaHI) and to compare it with their handedness in daily activities by the
Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI). The participants were 111 basketballers and 40
controls. All subjects completed the EHI and only basketballers filled in the BaHI.
To validate the BaHI, a voluntary subsample of basketballers repeated the BaHI.
Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor model. Our
results show that: (i) Handedness score (R) in daily actions did not differ between
basketball players (R by EHI = 69.3 ± 44.6) and the control group (R by EHI = 64.5 ±
58.6); (ii) basketballers more frequently favored performing certain sport tasks
with the left hand or mixed hands (as highlighted by R by BaHI = 50.1 ± 47.1),
although their choice was primarily the right hand in everyday gestures; and (iii)
this preference was especially true for athletes at the highest levels of
performance (R by BaHI of A1 league = 38.6 ± 58.3) and for those playing in selected
roles (point guard's R = 29.4 ± 67.4). Our findings suggest that professional
training induces handedness changes in basketball tasks. The BaHI provides a valid
and reliable measure of the skilled hand in basketball. This will allow coaches to
assess mastery of the ball according to the hand used by the athlete in the
different tasks and roles.

31389712	Ankle Sprains in the National Basketball Association, 2013-2014 Through 2016-2017.	"BACKGROUND: Ankle sprains are one of the most common injuries in basketball. Despite this, the incidence and setting of ankle sprains among elite basketball players are
not well described. PURPOSE: To describe the epidemiology of ankle sprains among
National Basketball Association (NBA) players. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of
evidence, 3. METHODS: All players on an NBA roster for ≥1 NBA game (preseason,
regular season, or playoffs) during the 2013-14 through 2016-17 seasons were
included. Data were collected with the NBA electronic medical record system. All NBA
teams used the electronic medical record continuously throughout the study period to
record comprehensive injury data, including onset, mechanism, setting, type, and
time lost. Game incidence rates were calculated per 1000 player-games and per 10,000
player-minutes of participation, stratified by demographic and playing
characteristics. RESULTS: There were 796 ankle sprains among 389 players and 2341
unique NBA player-seasons reported in the league from 2013-14 through 2016-17. The
overall single-season risk of ankle sprain was 25.8% (95% CI, 23.9%-28.0%). The
majority of ankle sprains occurred in games (n = 565, 71.0%) and involved a contact
mechanism of injury (n = 567, 71.2%). Most ankle sprains were lateral (n = 638,
80.2%). The incidence of ankle sprain among players with a history of prior ankle
sprain in the past year was 1.41 times (95% CI, 1.13-1.74) the incidence of those
without a history of ankle sprain in the past year (P = .002). Fifty-six percent of
ankle sprains did not result in any NBA games missed (n = 443); among those that
did, players missed a median of 2 games (interquartile range, 1-4) resulting in a
cumulative total of 1467 missed player-games over the 4-season study period.
CONCLUSION: Ankle sprains affect approximately 26% of NBA players on average each
season and account for a large number of missed NBA games in aggregate. Younger
players and players with a history of ankle sprain have elevated rates of incident
ankle sprains in games, highlighting the potential benefit for integrating injury
prevention programs into the management of initial sprains. Research on basketball-
and ankle-specific injury prevention strategies could provide benefits.

30468355	Effects of a combined strength and conditioning training program on physical	"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an in-season strength and conditioning program on physical abilities in under-16 sub-elite
basketball players. METHODS: Sixteen young male basketball players were assessed
using countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), 10-meters sprint and Pro Agility
Test, before and after an 8-week in-season strength and conditioning program. Both
the control group (BASK; N.=7) and the experimental group (SC; N.=9) were involved
in regular basketball practice; additionally, the SC group performed 4 sessions per
week of training intervention considering postmatch days and prior days to next
match. The training protocol consisted of three components: a stabilization block, a
neuromuscular/strength block (i.e. circuit of mobility, plyometric, coordination,
reaction, and stability exercises) and a power block (i.e. resisted movement
training performed with VertiMax V6 platform). RESULTS: Substantial improvements in
CMJ (likely; d=0.30-0.47) were found in both groups. Moreover, the SC group
displayed substantial increase in SJ (likely; d=0.07-1.26) and also in 10 m-sprint
(d=-0.13-1.34). The between-group analysis also revealed greater improvements for
the SC group in 10-m sprint (d=1.37) and SJ (d=0.50). CONCLUSIONS: In -season
regular basketball practice plus strength and conditioning training program can lead
to a greater improvement on jumping and sprinting abilities in male young basketball
players comparing to the regular basketball training.

(Yo-yo IR) performance was very likely increased in the TG (26,5 %). No improvements
in the Yo-Yo IR performance were found in the CG (-6,8%). Likely positive effects in
the TG were evident for the sprint and agility tests with (1.2 ± 2.4%, ES: 0.25,
p = 0.29) and without ball (1.5 ± 4.6%, ES: 0.34, p = 0.20). The sprint and agility
performance with ball significantly decreased in the CG by -2.8 ± 4.7% (ES: 0.49,
p < 0.01). No differences between the groups were found for counter movement jump
with arm swing (TG: ES = 0.14, p = 0.45, CG: ES = 0.20 p = 0.18), counter movement
jump (TG: ES = 0.05, p = 0.70, CG: ES = 0.19, p = 0.10), squat jump (TG: ES = 0.06,
p = 0.72, CG: ES = 0.10, p = 0.54) and long jump (TG: ES = 0.00, p = 0.82, CG:
ES = 0.00, p = 0.81). CONCLUSION: A 5-week, basketball-specific HIIT improves the
aerobic performance in young female basketball athletes.

28891550	Common types and countermeasures of ankle ligament injury caused by intense	"OBJECTIVE: To analyze ankle ligament injury of basketball players caused during movement, summarize injury types, analyze the causes of injury, and put forward
corresponding control measures. METHODS: The author selected 3100 basketball players
with ankle ligament injury during basketball movement and admitted to different
hospitals from June 2011 to June 2015 for stochastic analysis. Through the
literature, investigation, and observation, etc., common types of injuries of
basketball players are analyzed, and damage preventive measures of basketball
players are discussed, so as to find measures to prevent and treat ankle ligament
injury of basketball players and promote physical rehabilitation of players, which
is in favor of their better career development. RESULTS: Basketball players are
prone to ankle ligament injury in training or competition, which has a direct
relationship with players' poor safety consciousness and insufficient preparation
during movement. CONCLUSION: Basketball players will often have serious ankle
ligament injury in the process of movement. Basketball coaches and players should
reduce serious injury to players in training or competition, so as to stimulate
passion of more professional basketball sports students for basketball, which also
has a positive meaning for their future career.

29135275	The Effects of Playing Multiple High School Sports on National Basketball	"BACKGROUND: Athletes who specialize in their sport at an early age may be at risk for burnout, overuse injury, and reduced attainment of elite status. Timing of sport
specialization has not been studied in elite basketball athletes. HYPOTHESIS:
National Basketball Association (NBA) players who played multiple sports during
adolescence would be less likely to experience injury and would have higher
participation rates in terms of games played and career length compared with
single-sport athletes. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS:
First-round draft picks from 2008 to 2015 in the NBA were included in the study.
From publically available records from the internet, the following data were
collected for each athlete: participation in high school sports, major injuries
sustained in the NBA, percentage of games played in the NBA, and whether the athlete
was still active in the NBA. Athletes who participated in sports in addition to
basketball during high school were defined as multisport athletes and were compared
with athletes who participated only in basketball in high school. RESULTS: Two
hundred thirty-seven athletes were included in the study, of which 36 (15%) were
multisport athletes and 201 (85%) were single-sport athletes in high school. The
multisport cohort played in a statistically significantly greater percentage of
total games (78.4% vs 72.8%; P < .001). Participants in the multisport cohort were
less likely to sustain a major injury during their career (25% vs 43%, P = .03).
Finally, a greater percentage of the multisport athletes were active in the league
at time of data acquisition, indicating increased longevity in the NBA (94% vs
81.1%; P = .03). CONCLUSION: While a minority of professional basketball athletes
participated in multiple sports in high school, those who were multisport athletes
participated in more games, experienced fewer major injuries, and had longer careers
than those who participated in a single sport. Further research is needed to
determine the reasons behind these differences.

27872123	Effect of External Ankle Support on Ankle and Knee Biomechanics During the Cutting	"BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of lower extremity injuries in female basketball players as well as a high proportion of athletes who wear ankle braces,
there is a paucity of research pertaining to the effects of ankle bracing on ankle
and knee biomechanics during basketball-specific tasks. PURPOSE: To compare the
effects of a lace-up brace (ASO), a hinged brace (Active T2), and no ankle bracing
(control) on ankle and knee joint kinematics and joint reaction forces in female
basketball athletes during a cutting maneuver. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory
study. METHODS: Twenty healthy, semi-elite female basketball players performed a
cutting task under both ankle brace conditions (lace-up ankle brace and hinged ankle
brace) and a no-brace condition. The 3-dimensional kinematics of the ankle and knee
during the cutting maneuver were measured with an 18-camera motion analysis system
(250 Hz), and ground-reaction force data were collected by use of a multichannel
force plate (2000 Hz) to quantify ankle and knee joint reaction forces. Conditions
were randomized using a block randomization method. RESULTS: Compared with the
control condition, the hinged ankle brace significantly restricted peak ankle
inversion (mean difference, 1.7°; P = .023). No significant difference was found
between the lace-up brace and the control condition ( P = .865). Compared with the
lace-up brace, the hinged brace significantly reduced ankle and knee joint
compressive forces at the time of peak ankle dorsiflexion (mean difference, 1.5 N/kg
[ P = .018] and 1.4 N/kg [ P = .013], respectively). Additionally, the hinged ankle
brace significantly reduced knee anterior shear forces compared with the lace-up
brace both during the deceleration phase and at peak ankle dorsiflexion (mean
difference, 0.8 N/kg [ P = .018] and 0.9 N/kg [ P = .011], respectively).
CONCLUSION: The hinged ankle brace significantly reduced ankle inversion compared
with the no-brace condition and reduced ankle and knee joint forces compared with
the lace-up brace in a female basketball population during a cutting task. Compared
with the lace-up brace, the hinged brace may be a better choice of prophylactic
ankle support for female basketball players from a biomechanical perspective.
However, both braces increased knee internal rotation and knee abduction angles,
which may be problematic for a population that already has a high prevalence of knee
injuries.

31589636	Trends in NBA and Euroleague basketball: Analysis and comparison of statistical data	"We analyse and compare NBA and Euroleague basketball through box-score statistics in the period from 2000 to 2017. Overall, the quantitative differences between the NBA
and Euroleague have decreased and are still decreasing. Differences are even smaller
after we adjust for game length and when playoff NBA basketball is considered
instead of regular season basketball. The differences in factors that contribute to
success are also very small-(Oliver's) four factors derived from box-score
statistics explain most of the variability in team success even if the coefficients
are determined for both competitions simultaneously instead of each competition
separately. The largest difference is game pace-in the NBA there are more
possessions per game. The number of blocks, the defensive rebounding rate and the
number of free throws per foul committed are also higher in the NBA, while the
number of fouls committed is lower. Most of the differences that persist can be
reasonably explained by the contrasts between the better athleticism of NBA players
and more emphasis on tactical aspects of basketball in the Euroleague.

31580704	Epidemiology of Secondary School Boys' and Girls' Basketball Injuries: National	"CONTEXT: Little is known about non-time-loss (NTL) injury patterns in basketball athletes. Knowledge of these patterns may aid in the development of prevention and
management strategies for patients with these injuries. OBJECTIVE: To describe the
epidemiology of time-loss (TL) and NTL injuries sustained by secondary school boys'
and girls' basketball athletes. DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. SETTING:
Eighty-six unique schools provided data, with 84 and 83 contributing to boys' and
girls' basketball, respectively. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Athletes
participating in secondary school-sponsored boys' and girls' basketball. MAIN
OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Boys' and girls' basketball data from the National Athletic
Treatment, Injury and Outcomes Network (NATION) injury-surveillance program
(2011-2012 through 2013-2014 years) were analyzed. Injury counts, rates, and rate
ratios (IRRs) were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The NATION
captured 2653 injuries over 364 355 athlete-exposures (AEs) for boys' basketball and
2394 injuries over 288 286 AE for girls' basketball, producing rates of 7.28/1000
AEs (95% CI = 7.00, 7.56) for boys and 8.30/1000 AEs (95% CI = 7.97, 8.64) for
girls. The overall injury rates were slightly lower for boys (IRR = 0.88; 95% CI =
0.83, 0.93). For boys, 559 (21.1%) injuries were TL and 2094 (78.9%) were NTL,
producing a TL injury rate of 1.53/1000 AEs (95% CI = 1.40, 1.66) and an NTL injury
rate of 5.75/1000 AEs (95% CI = 5.50, 5.99). For girls, 499 (20.8%) injuries were TL
and 1895 (79.2%) were NTL, producing a TL injury rate of 1.73/1000 AEs (95% CI =
1.58, 1.88) and an NTL injury rate of 6.57/1000 AEs (95% CI = 6.28, 6.87). Rates of
TL injuries were similar between boys' and girls' basketball (IRR = 0.89; 95% CI =
0.79, 1.00); NTL injury rates were lower for boys (IRR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.82, 0.93).
CONCLUSIONS: When NTL injuries were included, the rates of injury in boys' and
girls' secondary school basketball were higher than previously reported.

27467516	Physical and Physiological Demands of Experienced Male Basketball Players During a	"Puente, C, Abián-Vicén, J, Areces, F, López, R, and Del Coso, J. Physical and physiological demands of experienced male basketball players during a competitive
game. J Strength Cond Res 31(4): 956-962, 2017-The aim of this investigation was to
analyze the physical and physiological demands of experienced basketball players
during a real and competitive game. Twenty-five well-trained basketball players (8
guards, 8 forwards, and 9 centers) played a competitive game on an outdoor court.
Instantaneous running speeds, the number of body impacts above 5 g, and the number
of accelerations and decelerations were assessed by means of a 15-Hz global
Positioning System accelerometer unit. Individual heart rate was also recorded using
heart rate monitors. As a group mean, the basketball players covered 82.6 ± 7.8
m·min during the game with a mean heart rate of 89.8 ± 4.4% of maximal heart rate.
Players covered 3 ± 3% of the total distance running at above 18 km·h and performed
0.17 ± 0.13 sprints per minute. The number of body impacts was 8.2 ± 1.8 per minute
of play. The running pace of forwards was higher than that of centers (86.8 ± 6.2
vs. 76.6 ± 6.0 m·min; p ≤ 0.05). The maximal speed obtained during the game was
significantly higher for guards than that for centers (24.0 ± 1.6 km·h vs. 21.3 ±
1.6 km·h; p ≤ 0.05). Centers performed a lower number of accelerations/decelerations
than guards and forwards (p ≤ 0.05). In conclusion, the extraordinary rates of
specific movements performed by these experienced basketball players indicate the
high physiological demands necessary to be able to compete in this sport. The
centers were the basketball players who showed lower physiological demands during a
game, whereas there were no differences between guards and forwards. These results
can be used by coaches to adapt basketball training programs to the specific demands
of each playing position.

31640316	Effects of basketball match-play on ankle dorsiflexion range of motion and vertical	"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of basketball match-play on ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) and countermovement (CMJ)
performance, and their association with internal match load. METHODS: Thirty
semi-professional basketball players participated in this study. Ankle dorsiflexion
ROM and bilateral CMJ performance were evaluated before (pre-match) and immediately
after match-play (post-match). In addition, ankle dorsiflexion ROM was measured 48
hours post-match. Furthermore, for each player, the ankle dorsiflexion ROM scores
were categorized as normal or restricted according to previously reported reference
values (>2 cm change from baseline pre-match to post-match and to 48 hours
post-match). RESULTS: Ankle dorsiflexion ROM was increased post-match from pre-match
in dominant and non-dominant limbs (most likely small) and decreased 48 hours
post-match (most likely moderate) compared with immediately post-match measures in
both limbs. Approximately 20% of all players showed restricted ankle dorsiflexion
ROM values 48 hours post-match. CMJ performance was higher post-match than
pre-match. CONCLUSIONS: Ankle dorsiflexion ROM is still reduced 48 h after a
competitive basketball match in semi-professional basketball players. The
implementation of specific recovery strategies aiming at minimizing a decrease in
ankle dorsiflexion after a match might be considered to reduce the likelihood of
ankle injury.

30616448	Goal-directed self-talk used to self-regulate in male basketball competitions.	"This study examined how goal-directed self-talk may help basketball players to self-regulate in stereotypical competitive situations: seconds before a challenging
game, while clearly winning or clearly losing, and at the close of a tight game.
Participants were recruited in groups of three to four, until preliminary inspection
of the data indicated that data saturation was reached. In the end, 34 basketball
players voluntarily took part in individual interviews, writing up to three
self-instructions they had used in each of the four competitive situations to
self-regulate. Content analyses revealed that self-talk in competitive basketball
situations serves cognitive functions (e.g., regulating cognition and behaviour),
motivational functions (e.g., promoting mastery goals) and emotion and
activation-regulating functions (e.g., creating activated states). More
specifically, the results also indicated that athletes' self-talk may serve
functions specific to the psychological demands experienced in each situation. It is
argued that knowing how athletes counsel themselves, could prove important for
applied sport psychologists to design psychological skill training.

31540824	Effects of foot orthoses on dynamic balance and basketball free-throw accuracy	"While it is not uncommon for athletes to use foot orthoses to relieve pain and improve sports performance, little has been known about their effects on basketball
performance. Free-throw basketball shooting is very important. However, fatigue
deteriorates postural balance which might decrease free-throw shooting performance.
This study investigated the effects of foot orthoses on dynamic balance and accuracy
performance during free-throw shooting before and after physical fatigue was
induced. Thirteen male recreational basketball players were tested with two foot
orthoses (medial-arch support versus flat control) and fatigue conditions (before
and after fatigue), when they performed standard free-throw shooting on a force
platform. Results revealed that fatigue significantly increased coefficient of
variance of medial-lateral center of pressure (CoP) excursion when participants worn
flat control orthoses (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, foot orthoses improved dynamic balance
during shooting as they significantly reduced total resultant and anterior-posterior
sway excursions as well as resultant and anterior-posterior CoP velocities, and base
of support area. Although this study found that fatigue and orthoses did not
significantly affect the scores gained by free-throw shooting, the significant
improvements in dynamic balance during shooting with the use of foot orthoses could
have considerable impact on motor control during basketball shooting.

26801923	The Effect of an Orthopaedic Surgical Procedure in the National Basketball	"BACKGROUND: Professional basketball players have a high incidence of injuries requiring surgical intervention. However, no studies in the current literature have
compared postoperative performance outcomes among common injuries to determine high-
and low-risk procedures to these athletes' careers. PURPOSE: To compare
return-to-play (RTP) rates and performance-based outcomes after different
orthopaedic procedures in National Basketball Association (NBA) players and to
determine which surgeries are associated with the worst postoperative change in
performance. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Athletes in
the NBA undergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, Achilles tendon
repair, lumbar discectomy, microfracture, meniscus surgery, hand/wrist or foot
fracture fixation, and shoulder stabilization were identified through team injury
reports and archives on public record. The RTP rate, games played per season, and
player efficiency rating (PER) were determined before and after surgery. Statistical
analysis was used to compare the change between pre- and postsurgical performance
among the different injuries. RESULTS: A total of 348 players were included. The RTP
rates were highest in patients with hand/wrist fractures (98.1%; mean age, 27.0
years) and lowest for those with Achilles tears (70.8%; mean age, 28.4 years) (P =
.005). Age ≥30 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.85; 95% CI, 1.24-11.91) and body mass index
≥27 kg/m(2) (OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.05-11.40) were predictors of not returning to play.
Players undergoing Achilles tendon repair and arthroscopic knee surgery had a
significantly greater decline in postoperative performance outcomes at the 1- and
3-year time points and had shorter career lengths compared with the other
procedures. CONCLUSION: NBA players undergoing Achilles tendon rupture repair or
arthroscopic knee surgery had significantly worse performance postoperatively
compared with other orthopaedic procedures.

30001184	The effect of increased shooting distance on energy flow in basketball jump shot.	"The aim of this study is to clarify the effect of shooting distance on energy flow in basketball jump shot. Ten male right-handed basketball players participated in
this study, and three successful shots at three different distances (short
condition, equating to a free-throw; long condition, equating to a three-point shot;
and mid condition, equating to the mid-point of the short- and long-condition shots)
were recorded using a motion capture system and force platforms. Kinetic variables
of joints during shooting were analysed using inverse dynamics method. Our results
showed that the joint work was not significantly different for short- and
mid-condition shots; however, the amount of energy transferred from the torso to the
shooting arm by the shoulder joint force increased significantly for the
mid-condition shots ([Formula: see text] as opposed to [Formula: see text] J/kg,
[Formula: see text]), whereas between the mid- and long-conditions, it was found
that the joint work in the lower limbs increased significantly ([Formula: see text]
as opposed to [Formula: see text] J/kg, [Formula: see text]). These results suggest
that sufficient energy transfer from the lower limbs to the shoot arms is important
to keep the motions of the shooting arms approximately constant when shooting from
various distances.

31731714	Influence of Functional Classification on Skill Tests in Elite Female Wheelchair	"Background and objectives: Wheelchair basketball players are classified into four functional classes according to the player's ""volume of action"", characterized by
trunk movement and stability. As this classification is based on a kinematic point
of view, test items might be differentially affected by the functional
classification level. We aimed to clarify field-based skill test items closely
related to the functional classification level. Materials and Methods: Twenty-six
female wheelchair basketball athletes (Japan National Team candidates) completed
seven field-based skill tests (20 m sprint, agility T-test, figure-eight with a ball
test, the Yo-Yo 10 m recovery test, and three types of maximal passes), and
anthropometric measurements were applied. Results: Significant differences among the
classification levels were found for one-hand maximal passes (baseball and hook
passes) and the figure-eight with a ball test. Furthermore, performance in the 20 m
sprint and 10 m Yo-Yo recovery tests significantly differed between classes 1 and 4.
Conclusions: The test items most influenced by the classification levels were
one-hand passes, which require trunk stability and balance not only in the
horizontal plane, but also in the sagittal and frontal planes. Coaches should
consider which test items are strongly affected by the functional classification
level when assessing a player's performance.

variables and threshold scores that distinguish players' physical performance in
each quarter. METHODS: Data was collected from ninety-four players who participated
in the study (age: 17.4 ± 0.74 years; height: 199.0 ± 0.1 cm; body mass: 87.1 ± 13.1
kg) competing in the Euroleague Basketball Next Generation Tournament. Players'
movements during the games were measured using a portable local positioning system
(LPS) (WIMU PRO®, Realtrack Systems SL, Almería, Spain) and included relative
distance (total distance / playing duration), relative distance in established speed
zones, high-intensity running (18.1-24.0 km·h-1) and sprinting (> 24.1 km·h-1).
player load, peak speed (km·h-1) and peak acceleration (m·s-2) number of total
accelerations and total decelerations, high intensity accelerations (> 2 m·s-2) and
decelerations (< -2 m·s-2). RESULTS: There was an overall decrease in distance
covered, player load, number of high intensity accelerations and decelerations
between the first and last quarter of the games in all playing positions. A
classification tree analysis showed that the first quarter had much influence of
distance covered (above 69.0 meters), distance covered <6.0 km·h-1 and accelerations
(> 2 m·s-2), whereas the fourth quarter performance had much influence of distance
covered (below 69.0) and distance covered 12.1-18.0 km·h-1. CONCLUSIONS: A
significant reduction in physical demands occurs during basketball, especially
between first and last quarter for players in all playing positions during
basketball games of under 18 elite players.

30540282	Influence of Different Methods to Determine Maximum Heart Rate on Training Load	"Berkelmans, DM, Dalbo, VJ, Fox, JL, Stanton, R, Kean, CO, Giamarelos, KE, Teramoto, M, and Scanlan, AT. Influence of different methods to determine maximum heart rate
on training load outcomes in basketball players. J Strength Cond Res 32(11):
3177-3185, 2018-The summated-heart-rate-zones (SHRZ) approach uses heart rate (HR)
responses relative to maximum HR (HRmax) to calculate the internal training load
(TL). Age-predicted, test-derived, and session-based approaches have all been used
to determine HRmax in team sports. The purpose of this study was to determine the
effects of using age-predicted, test-derived, and session-based HRmax responses on
SHRZ TL in basketball players. Semiprofessional, male basketball players (N = 6)
were analyzed during the preparatory training phase. Six age-based approaches were
used to predict HRmax including Fox (220 - age); Hossack (206 - [0.567 × age]);
Tanaka (208 - [0.7 × age]); Nikolaidis (223 - [1.44 × age]); Nes (211 - [0.64 ×
age]); and Faff (209.9 - [0.73 × age]). Test-derived HRmax was taken as the highest
HR during the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (Yo-Yo IRT), whereas session-based
HRmax was taken as the higher HR seen during the Yo-Yo IRT or training sessions.
Comparisons in SHRZ TL were made at group and individual levels. No significant
group differences were evident between SHRZ approaches. Effect size analyses
revealed moderate (d = 0.60-0.79) differences between age-predicted, test-derived,
and session-based methods across the group and individually in 2 players. The
moderate differences between approaches suggest age-predicted, test-derived, and
session-based methods to determine HRmax are not interchangeable when calculating
SHRZ. Basketball practitioners are encouraged to use individualized HRmax directly
measured during field-based tests supplemented with higher HR responses evident
during training sessions and games when calculating the SHRZ TL to ensure greatest
accuracy.

29431544	Monitoring Training Load and Well-Being During the In-Season Phase in National	"PURPOSE: To characterize the weekly training load (TL) and well-being of college basketball players during the in-season phase. METHODS: Ten (6 guards and 4
forwards) male basketball players (age 20.9 [0.9] y, stature 195.0 [8.2] cm, and
body mass 91.3 [11.3] kg) from the same Division I National Collegiate Athletic
Association team were recruited to participate in this study. Individualized
training and game loads were assessed using the session rating of perceived exertion
at the end of each training and game session, and well-being status was collected
before each session. Weekly changes (%) in TL, acute-to-chronic workload ratio, and
well-being were determined. Differences in TL and well-being between starting and
bench players and between 1-game and 2-game weeks were calculated using
magnitude-based statistics. RESULTS: Total weekly TL and acute-to-chronic workload
ratio demonstrated high week-to-week variation, with spikes up to 226% and 220%,
respectively. Starting players experienced a higher (most likely negative) total
weekly TL and similar (unclear) well-being status compared with bench players. Game
scheduling influenced TL, with 1-game weeks demonstrating a higher (likely negative)
total weekly TL and similar (most likely trivial) well-being status compared with
2-game weeks. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide college basketball coaches
information to optimize training strategies during the in-season phase. Basketball
coaches should concurrently consider the number of weekly games and player status
(starting vs bench player) when creating individualized periodization plans, with
increases in TL potentially needed in bench players, especially in 2-game weeks.

reality provides an added-value. To investigate these questions, varsity-level
basketball players underwent four training sessions during which they observed video
clips of basketball plays presented either on a computer screen (CS group) or using
a virtual reality headset (VR group). A third group watched footage from NCAA
playoff games on a computer screen (CTRL group). Decision-making was assessed
on-court before and after the training sessions using two types of plays: ""trained""
plays (presented during the CS and VR training sessions) and ""untrained"" plays
(presented only during the on-court tests). When facing the trained plays in the
posttest, both VR and CS groups significantly outperformed the CTRL group. In
contrast, when facing the untrained plays, the VR group outperformed both the CS and
CTRL groups. Our results indicate that CS training leads to transferable but
non-generalized decision-making gains while VR training leads to transferable and
generalized gains.

30676809	Monitoring Workload in Elite Female Basketball Players During the In-Season Phase:	"PURPOSE: To assess the weekly fluctuations in workload and differences in workload according to playing time in elite female basketball. METHODS: Twenty-nine female
basketball players (mean ± standard deviation, age: 21±5yr; stature: 181±7cm; body
mass: 71±7kg; and playing experience: 12±5yr) belonging to the 7 female basketball
teams competing in the first division Lithuanian Women's Basketball League (LMKL)
were recruited. Individualized training loads (TL) and game loads (GL) were assessed
using the session-RPE following each training session and game during the entire
in-season phase (24 weeks). Percentage (%) changes in total weekly TL (weekly
TL+GL), weekly TL, weekly GL, chronic workload, acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR),
training monotony, and training strain were calculated. Mixed linear models were
used to assess differences for each dependent variable, with playing time (low vs
high) used as fixed factor and subject, week, and team as random factors. RESULTS:
The highest changes in total weekly TL, weekly TL, and ACWR were evident in week 13
(47%, 120%, and 49% respectively). Chronic workload showed weekly changes ≤10%,
while monotony and training strain registered highest fluctuations in weeks 17 (34%)
and 15 (59%), respectively. A statistically significant difference in GL was evident
between players completing low and high playing times (p=0.026, moderate), while no
significant differences (p>0.05) were found for all other dependent variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Coaches of elite female basketball teams should monitor weekly changes
in workload during the in-season phase to identify weeks that may predispose players
to unwanted spikes and adjust player workload according to playing time.

25563677	The Effects of Plyometric Type Neuromuscular Training on Postural Control	"Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are common in basketball athletes; common preventive programs for decreasing these injures may be enhancing postural control
(PC) or balance with plyometric training. This study investigated the efficiency of
plyometric training program within basketball practice to improve PC performance in
young basketball players. Sixteen players were recruited and assigned either to a
plyometric + basketball training group (PT) or basketball training group (BT). All
players trained twice per week, but the PT + BT followed a 6-week plyometric program
implemented within basketball practice, whereas the BT followed regular practice.
The star excursion balance test (SEBT) at 8 directions (anterior, A; anteromedial,
AM; anterolateral, AL; medial, M; lateral, L; posterior, P; posteromedial, PM; and
posterolateral, PL) was measured before and after the 6-week period. The PT group
induced significant improvement (p ≤ 0.05) and small to moderate effect size in the
SEBT (A = 0.95, AM = 0.62, AL = 0.61, M = 0.36, L = 0.47, P = 0.27, PM = 0.25, PL =
0.24). No significant improvements were found in the BT group. Also, there were
significant differences between groups in all directions except PM and PL. An
integrated plyometric program within the regular basketball practice can lead to
significant improvements in SEBT and consequently PC. It can be recommended that
strength and conditioning professionals use PT to enhance the athletes' joint
awareness and PC to reduce possible future injuries in the lower extremity.

21731144	The effects of sleep extension on the athletic performance of collegiate basketball	"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of sleep extension over multiple weeks on specific measures of athletic performance as well as reaction time, mood, and
daytime sleepiness. SETTING: Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic and Research Laboratory
and Maples Pavilion, Stanford University, Stanford, CA. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven healthy
students on the Stanford University men's varsity basketball team (mean age 19.4 ±
1.4 years). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects maintained their habitual sleep-wake schedule
for a 2-4 week baseline followed by a 5-7 week sleep extension period. Subjects
obtained as much nocturnal sleep as possible during sleep extension with a minimum
goal of 10 h in bed each night. Measures of athletic performance specific to
basketball were recorded after every practice including a timed sprint and shooting
accuracy. Reaction time, levels of daytime sleepiness, and mood were monitored via
the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Profile of
Mood States (POMS), respectively. RESULTS: Total objective nightly sleep time
increased during sleep extension compared to baseline by 110.9 ± 79.7 min (P <
0.001). Subjects demonstrated a faster timed sprint following sleep extension (16.2
± 0.61 sec at baseline vs. 15.5 ± 0.54 sec at end of sleep extension, P < 0.001).
Shooting accuracy improved, with free throw percentage increasing by 9% and 3-point
field goal percentage increasing by 9.2% (P < 0.001). Mean PVT reaction time and
Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores decreased following sleep extension (P < 0.01). POMS
scores improved with increased vigor and decreased fatigue subscales (P < 0.001).
Subjects also reported improved overall ratings of physical and mental well-being
during practices and games. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in specific measures of
basketball performance after sleep extension indicate that optimal sleep is likely
beneficial in reaching peak athletic performance.

30844988	Analysis of Physiological and Kinematic Demands of Wheelchair Basketball Games-A	"Seron, BB, Oliveira de Carvalho, EM, and Greguol, M. Analysis of physiological and kinematic demands of wheelchair basketball games-A review. J Strength Cond Res
33(5): 1453-1462, 2019-In wheelchair basketball (WB), knowledge of the specificities
of the game is essential for efficient planning of training strategies for high
performance. This study aimed to review the literature concerning studies that have
investigated physiological and kinematic measures during WB games. The literature
search took place in 4 electronic databases: Scopus, MEDLINE-PubMed, SPORTDiscus,
and CINAHL. The inclusion criteria for this review were as follows: (a) articles
that evaluated the behavior of physiological and kinematic variables during WB
games; (b) athletes aged at least 18 years; and (c) participants with a minimum of 1
year in the modality practice. The selected studies (n = 16) were divided into 2
groups: physiological analysis (n = 11) and kinematic analysis (n = 5). In analyzing
the studies, it was observed that the WB game is very demanding in relation to
cardiovascular requirements (∼65% of the time is spent in zones of high heart rate
[HR] intensity and 70% of V[Combining Dot Above]O2peak). Edwards and Stagno methods
seem to be adequate for the control of internal loads imposed on WB players, and
moderate correlations were found between rating of perceived exertion measures and
HR-based methods. Considering the methodological limitations, kinematic analysis in
WB games is rather inconsistent (distance traveled between 2.6 and 5 km; average
speed between 1.8 and 2.0 m·s; maximum speed = 4 m·s). Despite the gaps observed in
this context, the execution of rotational movements seems to have great relevance
for WB. We can conclude that different methods have been adequate for the internal
load control in WB games. However, the results of the external demands are not
enough to determine a profile nor to serve as parameters for the training
prescription for athletes of the modality.

31438776	Benefits of a Guided Motor-Mental Preperformance Routine on Learning the Basketball	"While past research has shown the benefits of preperformance routines (PPRs) on athletes' performances, only a few studies have addressed PPR effects on novices'
learning or performance. This study investigated the effect of motor-mental PPR on
learning the basketball free throw. We categorized 45 undergraduate male students
into three 15-session training groups receiving (a) a five-step PPR based on
Singer's model, (b) a self-regulation PPR, and (c) no PPR, but only a basketball
free throw performance (control group). One week later, we conducted retention and
transfer testing. A repeated measures analysis of variance and two-way mixed design
analysis of variance showed that, in the acquisition and test phases, the five-step
PPR group performed better than the other two groups (p < .001), and there was no
significant difference between the self-regulation PPR and control groups. The
results also showed that, in accordance with the specificity of practice hypothesis,
participants' performance decreased significantly on transfer testing when PPR was
removed from the experimental groups. A well-guided motor-mental PPR was superior to
a self-regulated PPR for novices learning this basketball skill, probably because it
increased the participants' concentration during acquisition and helped them learn
it as part of a motor pattern.

30801503	Intraocular Pressure as an Indicator of the Level of Induced Anxiety in Basketball.	"SIGNIFICANCE: Our data demonstrate that intraocular pressure (IOP) is sensitive to anxiety manipulation in sport scenarios, specifically in a basketball free throw
task. The present outcomes may be of special relevance because of its practical
advantages for the objective control of athletes' anxiety levels. PURPOSE: Athletes
experience high levels of anxiety during sport competition, and IOP has demonstrated
to reflect autonomous nervous system changes during mentally demanding situations.
We tested whether different levels of induced anxiety during basketball free throw
shooting alter IOP. METHODS: We followed a repeated-measures design to test the
effects of anxiety-induced manipulation during basketball free throw shooting on
IOP, shooting performance, and perceived anxiety. Eighteen amateur basketball
players performed three experimental sessions consisting of 100 free throws each.
However, we gave three different instructions to participants regarding the score
assigned to each free throw, allowing us to manipulate the level of induced anxiety
(low, medium, and high). RESULTS: Confirming a successful anxiety manipulation,
basketball players reported more perceived anxiety with higher levels of induced
anxiety (P < .001, η = 0.37). Our data show that higher levels of induced anxiety
provoke an acute IOP rise (P < .001, η = 0.44), with the low-, medium-, and
high-anxiety-induced conditions promoting an average IOP rise of 0.21, 1.63, and
18.46%, respectively. Also, there was a linear IOP rise over time in the
high-anxiety-induced condition (r = 0.82). Nevertheless, we found no effect of
anxiety-induced manipulation on basketball free throw performance (P = .93).
CONCLUSIONS: Intraocular pressure is sensitive to anxiety-induced manipulation
during basketball free throw shooting, showing an increase in parallel with
accumulated anxiety. Based on these findings, IOP may be considered a promising tool
for the assessment of the level of anxiety in certain sport situations. Future
studies are required to explore the generalizability of these results in other
scenarios with different physical and mental demands.

28799865	Space Creation Dynamics in Basketball Small-Sided Games.	"Space creation dynamics (SCDs) describe actions players perform to create a scoring opportunity. This study compared SCDs and types of offense during three different
three versus three (3vs.3) basketball small-sided games (SSGs) played in half court:
3vs.3 with man-to-man defense in half playing area (3vs.3(HALF)), 3vs.3 with
man-to-man defense in full playing area (3vs.3(FULL)), and 3vs.3 with reduced shot
clock (3vs.3(RT)). We also investigated the efficacy of SCDs in all SSGs and the
reliability of SCDs in 3vs.3(HALF). While the efficacy of SCDs did not differ among
these SSGs, 3vs.3(RT) presented significantly more ""space creation with ball
dribbled"" and ""shot clock violations,"" and less ""on ball screens."" 3vs.3(FULL)
presented no differences in the SCDs and types of offense compared with 3vs.3(HALF).
Reliability within 3vs.3(HALF) was higher for ""space creation with ball dribbled,""
""space creation without the ball,"" ""set offenses,"" ""fast breaks,"" and ""loss of ball
during passing or dribbling."" We concluded that 3vs.3 basketball SSGs with different
rules can be used for training different tactical behaviors important to formal
games, especially since the 3vs.3(HALF) presented good reliability for many
variables related to tactical behavior.

28368952	Physical Determinants of Division 1 Collegiate Basketball, Women's National	"Spiteri, T, Binetti, M, Scanlan, AT, Dalbo, VJ, Dolci, F, and Specos, C. Physical determinants of Division 1 Collegiate basketball, Women's National Basketball
League, and Women's National Basketball Association athletes: with reference to
lower-body sidedness. J Strength Cond Res 33(1): 159-166, 2019-In female basketball,
the assumed components of success include power, agility, and the proficiency at
executing movements using each limb. However, the importance of these attributes in
discriminating between playing levels in female basketball has yet to be determined.
The purpose of this study was to compare lower-body power, change of direction (COD)
speed, agility, and lower-body sidedness between basketball athletes participating
in Division 1 Collegiate basketball (United States), Women's National Basketball
League (WNBL) (Australia), and Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA)
(United States). Fifteen female athletes from each league (N = 45) completed a
double- and single-leg countermovement jump (CMJ), static jump, drop jump, 5-0-5 COD
test, and an offensive and a defensive agility test. One-way analysis of variance
with post hoc comparisons were conducted to compare differences in physical
characteristics (height, body mass, age) and performance outcomes (jump, COD,
agility assessments) between playing levels. Separate dependent t-tests were
performed to compare lower-body sidedness (left vs. right lower limbs) during the
single-leg CMJ jumps (vertical jump height) and 5-0-5 COD test for each limb within
each playing level. WNBA athletes displayed significantly greater lower-body power
(p = 0.01-0.03) compared with WNBL athletes, significantly faster COD speed (p =
0.02-0.03), and offensive and defensive agility performances (p = 0.02-0.03)
compared with WNBL and Collegiate athletes. The WNBL athletes also produced a faster
defensive agility performance compared with Collegiate athletes (p = 0.02).
Furthermore, WNBA and WNBL athletes exhibited reduced lower-body sidedness compared
with Collegiate athletes. These findings indicate the importance of lower-body
power, agility, and reduced lower-body imbalances to execute more proficient
on-court movements required to compete at higher playing levels.

Cond Res 32(2): 396-408, 2018-The National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft
Combine is an annual event where prospective players are evaluated in terms of their
athletic abilities and basketball skills. Data collected at the Combine should help
NBA teams select right the players for the upcoming NBA draft; however, its value
for predicting future performance of players has not been examined. This study
investigated predictive validity of the NBA Draft Combine on future performance of
basketball players. We performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the
2010-2015 Combine data to reduce correlated variables (N = 234), a correlation
analysis on the Combine data and future on-court performance to examine
relationships (maximum pairwise N = 217), and a robust principal component
regression (PCR) analysis to predict first-year and 3-year on-court performance from
the Combine measures (N = 148 and 127, respectively). Three components were
identified within the Combine data through PCA (= Combine subscales): length-size,
power-quickness, and upper-body strength. As per the correlation analysis, the
individual Combine items for anthropometrics, including height without shoes,
standing reach, weight, wingspan, and hand length, as well as the Combine subscale
of length-size, had positive, medium-to-large-sized correlations (r = 0.313-0.545)
with defensive performance quantified by Defensive Box Plus/Minus. The robust PCR
analysis showed that the Combine subscale of length-size was a predictor most
significantly associated with future on-court performance (p ≤ 0.05), including Win
Shares, Box Plus/Minus, and Value Over Replacement Player, followed by upper-body
strength. In conclusion, the NBA Draft Combine has value for predicting future
performance of players.

28745471	Visual control in basketball shooting under exertion conditions.	"BACKGROUND: This study examined the effect of physical exertion on gaze behavior during basketball shooting in both stationary and dynamic conditions. METHODS:
Thirteen skilled basketball players performed two-point shooting during a 60 second
fatigue protocol. Before and after a jump shot test, players performed two free
throws. Eye movements were registered using an SMI Mobile EyeTracker. The frequency
of all fixation points (number) and fixation duration during the motor phases of
shooting were determined using frame-by-frame analysis. RESULTS: The type of
basketball shot differentiated gaze control: 1) fixations were longer and more
frequent during free throws as compared to jump shots; 2) shooting accuracy was
positively influenced by less frequent and longer fixations; 3) physical exertion
resulted in significantly more frequent fixations during free throws; and 4)
exertion conditions resulted in a high variation in the patterns of total fixation
times during jump shots. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that physical exertion
may reduce oculomotor efficiency during aiming at a distant target. Moreover,
stationary and dynamic shots require different gaze behavior strategies.

randomised controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT02530333) compared biomechanical
adaptations in basketball and soccer players during jump-landing activities after an
ACL injury prevention programme. Eighty-seven athletes were cluster randomised into
intervention (6-week programme) and control groups. Three-dimensional biomechanical
analyses of drop vertical jump (DVJ), double- (SAG-DL) and single-leg (SAG-SL)
sagittal, and double- (FRONT-DL) and single-leg (FRONT-SL) frontal plane jump
landing tasks were tested before and after the intervention. Peak angles,
excursions, and joint moments were analysed using two-way MANCOVAs of post-test
scores while controlling for pre-test scores. During SAG-SL the basketball
intervention group exhibited increased peak knee abduction angles (p = .004) and
excursions (p = .003) compared to the basketball control group (p = .01) and soccer
intervention group (p = .01). During FRONT-SL, the basketball intervention group
exhibited greater knee flexion excursion after training than the control group
(p = .01), but not the soccer intervention group (p = .11). Although women's soccer
players exhibit greater improvements in knee abduction kinematics than basketball
players, these athletes largely exhibit similar biomechanical adaptations to ACL

31147148	Comparison of 3 ankle braces in reducing ankle inversion in a basketball rebounding	"Lateral ankle injury incidence rates are very high in the sport of basketball, with a significant proportion occurring during rebounding. Ankle braces are often used as
preventative and rehabilitative techniques in the hope of minimizing the likelihood
of experiencing excessive ankle inversion. This study aims to evaluate the effect of
different ankle braces in preventing ankle inversion during a basketball rebounding
task. Sixteen subjects participated in the study (11 males, 5 females; mean
age = 26.94 years, SD = 5.32; mean height 1.72 m, SD = 0.08; mean weight 73.95 kg,
SD = 13.68). Participants performed a simulated rebounding task in multiple braced
conditions: unbraced (UB), Ossur Formfit (OF), Talarmade Ankleguard Air/Gel Stirrup
(TAG) and Bauerfeind Malleoloc (BF). Ankle and foot inversion angles, ankle
inversion moments and peroneus longus EMG activity were recorded and analysed to
determine the effectiveness of each condition to resist inversion. All braced
conditions reduced ankle and foot inversion angles compared to UB. In the
non-dominant limb, OF showed reduced maximum ankle inversion compared to BF
(non-dominant mean difference = 0.630°, p < 0.001) and reduced foot inversion
compared to TAG (non-dominant mean difference = 0.966°, p = 0.035). Compared to UB,
OF and TAG increased ankle inversion moments in the dominant ankle and showed
decreases in the non-dominant ankle. BF reduced mean peak peroneus longus EMG
activity compared to all other trials. Whilst statistically significant differences
that were demonstrated between several braced conditions are relatively small, they
are clinically significant knowing that the maximum barefoot inversion whilst
standing is less than 17 degrees.

period on relative exercise intensities was evaluated. Ten basketballers wore
accelerometers during a Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (Yo-Yo-IR1) and 18
competitive matches. Relative exercise intensity was quantified using predicted
oxygen consumption reserve determined using correlations from Yo-Yo-IR1. Total time,
bout frequency and bout duration were calculated in seven intensity zones and
compared between quarters, positions (back-court vs. front-court) and roles
(starters vs. bench). Back-court players spent 6.0±1.9% more match time performing
supramaximal activity when compared to front-court players (p<0.045). Back-court
players experienced more supramaximal bouts (125±37 vs. 52±36; p=0.031) of greater
average duration (2.1±0.4 vs. 1.4±0.2 s; p=0.021) and maximum duration (7±2 vs. 3±1
s; p=0.020). More sedentary to very light activity was observed in the 2(nd) and
4(th) quarters compared to the 1(st) and 3(rd) quarters (p<0.05). Despite reduced
playing time, bench players performed similar amounts of maximal and supramaximal
exercise when compared to starters (p≥0.279). Player position, role and match
periods influence the demands of women's basketball; these factors should be
considered when designing match-specific conditioning programs.

27879168	Situation criticality and basketball officials' stress levels.	"Officials are expected to perform impeccably despite the wide range of stressors they experience. A stressor that officials frequently report is situation
criticality. Situation criticality is comprised of score differential (i.e., more
pressure in close games) and time remaining in a game (i.e., more pressure as time
expires), which affects athletes' stress levels. The present study explored the
effect of situation criticality on officials' stress levels. High school basketball
officials (n = 108) with an average of 18.1 (SD = 11.2) years of officiating
experience were given a survey packet containing game situations that varied in
criticality. For each game situation (n = 9) officials completed the overall stress
and appraisal portions of the Stress Appraisal Measure (SAM). Results revealed that
situation criticality has an effect on officials' perceived stress levels. Both
threat and challenge appraisals were positively correlated with perceived stress.
Overall, these findings indicate that officials' stress levels fluctuate within
games depending on score differential and time of game. The findings encourage
officials to recognise and manage their stress, possibly through their appraisals.
Additionally, the findings can affect the training of officials in the management of
stress, as well as prompt the consideration of potential rule changes that reflect
the increased situational demands on officials in critical situations (e.g.,
expanded instant replay).

Basketball League or socially had their 2D:4Ds measured. Analysis of variance was
used to assess differences in mean 2D:4Ds between men playing at different
competitive standards, with relationships between 2D:4Ds and basketball game-related
statistics assessed using Pearson's product moment correlations in men playing at a
single competitive standard. RESULTS: There were significant differences between
competitive standards for the left 2D:4D following Bonferroni correction, but not
for the right 2D:4D, with basketballers who achieved higher competitive standards
tending to have lower left 2D:4Ds. No important correlations between 2D:4D and
basketball game-related statistics were found, with correlations typically
negligible. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that the 2D:4D can discriminate
between basketballers competing at different standards, but not between
basketballers within a single competitive standard using objective game-related

basketball movements. Seventeen university basketball players performed running
vertical jumps and 5-m sprints at maximum effort with 3 basketball shoes of various
forefoot plate conditions (medial plate, medial + lateral plates, and no-plate
control). One-way repeated measures ANOVAs were used to examine the differences in
athletic performance, joint kinematics, and joint kinetics among the 3 footwear
conditions (α = .05). Results indicated that participants wearing medial + lateral
plates shoes demonstrated 2.9% higher jump height than those wearing control shoes
(P = .02), but there was no significant differences between medial plate and control
shoes (P > .05). Medial plate shoes produced greater maximum plantar flexion
velocity than the medial + lateral plates shoes (P < .05) during sprinting. There
were no significant differences in sprint time. These findings implied that
inserting plates spanning both the medial and lateral aspects of the forefoot could
enhance jumping, but not sprinting performances. The use of a medial plate alone,
although induced greater plantar flexion velocity at the metatarsophalangeal joint
during sprinting, was not effective in improving jump heights or sprint times.

studied the role of basketball expertise on this, the so-called head-fake effect, in
three groups of participants (basketball experts, soccer players, and non-athletes).
The specific focus was on the dependency of the head-fake effect on previous fake
experience as an index of control over the processing of task-irrelevant gaze
information. Whereas (overall) the head-fake effect was of similar size in all
expertise groups, preceding fake experience removed the head-fake effect in
basketball players, but not in non-experts. Accordingly, basketball expertise allows
for higher levels of control over the processing of task-irrelevant gaze
information.

distance. We computed a linear mixed model with test (pretest-posttest), group
(constant-variable), and test × group interaction in order to analyze the total
fixation duration and number of fixations. The average fixation duration was
analyzed with a repeated measure two-way ANOVA, with practice conditions as a
between-participants factor and test type as a within-participants factor. We found
that the total fixation duration increased significantly in the posttest, regardless
of the practice conditions (p < 0.001, effect size = 0.504). The number of fixations
also increased significantly in the posttest (p = 0.037, effect size = 0.246). The
average fixation duration increased in both groups; however, insignificantly. We
also did not find any significant differences between groups. Our results suggest
that variable and constant practice conditions may lead to the development of
similar gaze behavior.

28965347	Construct Validity of Accelerometry-Derived Force to Quantify Basketball Movement	"This study assessed the construct validity of accelerometry-derived net force to quantify the external demands of basketball movements. Twenty-eight basketballers
completed the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (Yo-Yo-IR1) and basketball exercise
simulation test (BEST). Intensity was quantified using accelerometry-derived average
net force (AvF(Net)) and PlayerLoad(TM) per minute (PL/min). Within-player
correlations were determined between intensity and running speed during Yo-Yo-IR1.
Measured AvF(Net) was determined for movements during the BEST and predicted
AvF(Net) was calculated using movement speed and correlations from Yo-Yo-IR1.
Relationships between AvF(Net) and running speed during Yo-Yo-IR1 were nearly
perfect (r(2)=0.95, 95% CI: 0.94-0.96; p<0.001) and stronger than correlations
between running speed and PL/min (r(2)=0.80, 95% CI: 0.73-0.87; p<0.001).
Differences between measured and predicted AvF(Net) were small during jogging and
running (<1%), but large for basketball movements including jumping,
change-of-direction and shuffling (15%-41%). As hypothesised, AvF(Net) differed by
playing position (11%-16%; p<0.001) and reflected the additional demand upon players
with larger body mass and lower movement efficiency. Both sprint speed and AvF(Net)
reduced during the course of the BEST (p≤0.013). These findings confirm the
construct validity of AvF(Net) to quantify the external demand of basketball
movements. Accelerometry-derived net force has the potential to quantify the
external demands of basketballers during training and competition.

29303400	The 'Sequence of Prevention' for musculoskeletal injuries among recreational	"OBJECTIVE: Currently, there is no overview of the incidence and (basketball-specific) risk factors of musculoskeletal injuries among recreational
basketball players, nor any insight into the effect of preventive measures on the
incidence of basketball injuries. This study aimed to gather systematically the
scientific evidence on the incidence, prevalence, aetiology and preventive measures
for musculoskeletal injuries among recreational basketball players. METHODS: Highly
sensitive search strategies were built based on three groups of keywords (and
related search terms). Two electronic databases were searched, namely Medline
(biomedical literature) via Pubmed, and SPORTDiscus (sports and sports medicine
literature) via EBSCOhost. RESULTS: The incidence of musculoskeletal injuries among
recreational basketball players ranged from 0.0047 injuries per 1,000
athlete-exposures (AE) for dental injuries to 10.1 injuries per 1000 AE for overall
injuries during match play. Significant risk factors for injuries were defending,
postural sway, high vertical ground reaction force during jumping and weight >75 kg.
All prevention studies have shown to have a significant effect on reducing the risk
of injury ranging from an odds ratio (95% confidence interval (CI)) of 0.175
(0.049-0.626) for training injuries and a relative risk (95% CI) of 0.83 (0.57-1.19)
achieved with FIFA 11+ prevention exercises and sport-specific balance training,
relatively. CONCLUSION: In order to gain insight in the aetiology of
basketball-specific injuries and consequently facilitate the development of
preventive strategies, more high quality basketball-specific and injury-specific
studies among recreational basketball players are needed.

31221050	Effect of shoe wearing time and midsole hardness on ground reaction forces, ankle	"This study examined the effect of wearing time on comfort perception and landing biomechanics of basketball shoes with different midsole hardness. Fifteen basketball
players performed drop landing and layup first step while wearing shoes of different
wearing time (new, 2-, 4-, 6- and 8-week) and hardness (soft, medium and hard).
Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures was performed on GRF, ankle kinematic and
comfort perception variables. Increased wearing time was associated with poorer
force attenuation and comfort perception during landing activities (p < 0.05). The
new shoes had significantly smaller forefoot (2- and 4-week) and rearfoot peak GRF
impacts (all time conditions) in drop landing and smaller rearfoot peak GRF impact
(6- and 8-week) in layup; shoes with 4-week of wearing time had significantly better
perceptions of forefoot cushioning, forefoot stability, rearfoot cushioning,
rearfoot stability and overall comfort than the new shoes (p < 0.05). Compared with
hard shoes, the soft shoes had better rearfoot cushioning but poorer forefoot
cushioning (p < 0.05). Shoe hardness and wearing time would play an influential role
in GRF and comfort perception, but not in ankle kinematics. Although shoe cushioning
performance would decrease even after a short wearing period, the best comfort
perception was found at 4-week wearing time.

dynamic information presented under different conditions: a verbal condition, in
which instructions were given orally; a visual condition, in which instructions were
shown using arrow symbols; and a redundant condition, in which both visual and
verbal instructions were presented simultaneously. Method: In a 2 × 3 design, we
asked basketball players with varied levels of skill (less-skilled, skilled) to rate
their invested mental effort and to perform a recall test after learning from either
the verbal, visual or redundant condition. Results: Results demonstrated that the
less-skilled players benefited more from the redundant condition, whereas the
skilled participants benefited more from the visual condition. Conclusion:
Recommendations for improving instructional design techniques aimed at the
transmission of tactical instructions in team games are proposed.

29334021	A Comparison of Training and Competition Demands in Semiprofessional Male Basketball	"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to quantify and compare training and competition demands in basketball. METHODS: Fifteen semiprofessional male basketball
players wore microsensors during physical conditioning training (PCT), games-based
training (GBT), and competition to measure absolute and relative (·min(-1))
PlayerLoad(TM) (PL) and estimated equivalent distance (EED). Internal responses were
calculated using absolute and relative session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE)
and summated heart rate zones (SHRZ). Integrated measures were calculated as sRPE:PL
and SHRZ:PL ratios. RESULTS: PlayerLoad (arbitrary units [AU]) and EED (m) were
statistically significantly (p < .05) higher during PCT (632 ± 139 AU, d = 1.36;

41.01 ± 10.29 m·min(-1)). Summated heart rate zones were statistically significantly
(p < .05) higher during PCT (314 ± 86 AU, d = 1.05; 3.22 ± 0.50 AU·min(-1),
d = 1.94) and GBT (334 ± 79 AU, d = 1.38; 3.19 ± 0.54 AU·min(-1), d = 1.83) than
they were during competition (225 ± 77 AU; 2.17 ± 0.69 AU·min(-1)). The ratio of

26038836	Basketball shot types and shot success in different levels of competitive	"The purpose of our research was to investigate the relative frequencies of different types of basketball shots (above head, hook shot, layup, dunk, tip-in), some details
about their technical execution (one-legged, two-legged, drive, cut, …), and shot
success in different levels of basketball competitions. We analysed video footage
and categorized 5024 basketball shots from 40 basketball games and 5 different
levels of competitive basketball (National Basketball Association (NBA), Euroleague,
Slovenian 1st Division, and two Youth basketball competitions). Statistical analysis
with hierarchical multinomial logistic regression models reveals that there are
substantial differences between competitions. However, most differences decrease or
disappear entirely after we adjust for differences in situations that arise in
different competitions (shot location, player type, and attacks in transition).
Differences after adjustment are mostly between the Senior and Youth competitions:
more shots executed jumping or standing on one leg, more uncategorised shot types,
and more dribbling or cutting to the basket in the Youth competitions, which can all
be attributed to lesser technical and physical ability of developing basketball
players. The two discernible differences within the Senior competitions are that, in
the NBA, dunks are more frequent and hook shots are less frequent compared to
European basketball, which can be attributed to better athleticism of NBA players.
The effect situational variables have on shot types and shot success are found to be
very similar for all competitions.

25270778	Influence of a sport-specific training background on vertical jumping and throwing	"AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of 3 years of sport-specific training background (SSTB) on vertical jumping and throwing
performance in young female basketball and volleyball players. METHODS: Thirty-one
healthy adolescent girls, of which 11 age-matched control subjects [C], 10
basketballers (BP) and 10 volleyballers (VP) participated to the study. The throwing
performance was assessed by seated backward overhead ball throw (SBOMBT) and seated
chest pass throw (SCPT) using a 3-kg rubber medicine ball. Instead, the vertical
jumping performance was evaluated by squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump with
(CMJ-AS) and without arm swing (CMJ) using Optojump system (Microgate srl, Italy).
RESULTS: During SJ and CMJ with and without arm swing VP group showed a higher
vertical jump performance than BP and C ones. In particular we showed that VP
exhibited a higher flight time and jump height than C (P<0.05) in SJ, CMJ and CMJ-AS
tests. Players showed higher performances than C in SCPT and SBOMBT. However, we
found only a significant difference (P<0.05) in the comparison between BP and C
during SCPT. Moreover, we found significant correlations between SBOBMT performances
and CMJ-AS jump heights in C (r= 0.60; p= 0.02) and VP (r= 0.81; p<0.01) groups
compared to BP one (r= -0.47; p= 0.08). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that 3 years
of SSTB might be able to promote significant neuromuscular adaptations in volleyball
and basketball athletes' maximal power compared to age-matched control subjects.

28271958	Linking performance decline to choking: players' perceptions in basketball.	"This study was aimed at examining how basketball players view unexpected performance errors in basketball, and under what conditions they perceive them as choking.
Fifty-three basketball players were randomly assigned into 2 groups (game half) to
evaluate the linkage between performance decline and choking as a function of
game-time, score gap and game half. Within each group, players viewed 8 scenario
clips, which featured a different player conducting an error, and subsequently rated
the extent of performance decline, the instance of choking and the salience of
various performance attributions regarding the error. The analysis revealed that
choking was most salient in the 2nd half of the game, but an error was perceived as
choking more saliently in the beginning of the 2nd half. This trend was also shown
for players' perception of performance decline. Players' ratings of the attributions
assigned to errors, however, revealed that during the end of the 2nd half, time
pressure and lack of concentration were the causes of errors. Overall, the results
provide evidence towards a conceptual framework linking performance decline to the
perception of choking, and that errors conducted by players are perceived as choking
when there is not a salient reason to suggest its occurrence.

28963129	Trapped sweat in basketball uniforms and the effect on sweat loss estimates.	"The aims of this study were to determine: (1) trapped sweat (TS) in basketball uniforms and the effect on sweat loss (SL) estimates during a laboratory-based
basketball simulation protocol; (2) the impact of exercise intensity, body mass,
age, and SL on TS; and (3) TS during on-court training to assess the ecological
validity of the laboratory-based results. Twenty-four recreational/competitive male
basketball players (23 ± 10 years, 77.0 ± 16.7 kg) completed three randomized
laboratory-based trials (Low, Moderate, and High intensity) consisting of 150-min
intermittent exercise. Eighteen elite male players (23 ± 4 years, 92.0 ± 20.6 kg)
were observed during coach-led, on-court training. Nude and clothed body mass were
measured pre and postexercise to determine TS. Data are mean ± SD. There was a
significant effect of intensity on SL and TS (P < 0.001, Low<Moderate<High, ANOVA).
During Low, subjects lost 1.10 ± 0.59 kg sweat and TS was 0.11 ± 0.15 kg (8.0 ± 5.1%
SL). During Moderate, subjects lost 1.60 ± 0.56 kg sweat and TS was 0.21 ± 0.21 kg
(11.6 ± 6.3% SL). During High, subjects lost 2.12 ± 0.66 kg sweat and TS was
0.38 ± 0.28 kg (16.0 ± 7.4% SL). Multiple regression and partial correlation
analysis suggested TS was significantly related to SL (P < 0.0001; partial
r = 0.81-0.89), whereas the contributions of body mass (P = 0.22-0.92) and age
(P = 0.29-0.44) were not significant. TS during on-court training was
0.35 ± 0.36 kg, which was associated with a 14.1 ± 11.5% underestimation in SL, and
was not statistically different than laboratory-based results (P = 0.59). Clothed
body mass measurements should be used with caution, as TS is highly variable and can
cause a significant underestimation in SL in athletes with high sweating rates.

30251289	Relationships between the digit ratio (2D:4D) and game-related statistics in	"OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to examine relationships between digit ratio (2D:4D) and game-related statistics in professional and semi-professional male
basketball players. The secondary aim was to quantify differences in mean 2D:4Ds
between starting and reserve players. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, 93
male basketball players from the professional Australian National Basketball League
and the semi-professional South Australian Premier League were measured in-season
for height, mass, and 2D:4D, with game-related statistics collected end-season.
Linear relationships between right and left 2D:4Ds and game-related statistics were
quantified using nonparametric partial correlations, and differences in mean 2D:4Ds
between starting and reserve players were quantified using analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA). All partial correlations and ANCOVAs were adjusted for playing experience,
body size, and competitive standard. RESULTS: 2D:4D was a weak to moderate negative
correlate of points scored and assists-to-turnovers ratio, indicating that males
with lower 2D:4Ds were generally better offensively as they recorded more points and
assists relative to turnovers. The difference in mean 2D:4D between starting and
reserve players was negligible. CONCLUSIONS: 2D:4D was favorably correlated with
open-skill sports performance, as evidenced by the better offensive statistics of
male basketball players with lower 2D:4Ds. These results probably reflect the
organizational benefits of prenatal testosterone and indicate that 2D:4D may be a
useful complement to traditional physical, physiological, skill, and behavioral
predictors of basketball success.

26558837	Decreased interlimb differences in female basketball players.	"BACKGROUND: Hand preference can be influenced by some factors like sensory information and sports participation. In many sports, it is always desirable to have
the similar performance of both hands to adapt to the fast changes of the game.
Elite basketball players use their left non-dominant hand more accurately and more
frequently during the game compared to amateurs. However, there is no quantitative
data to explain this phenomenon. The aim of the study was to test whether
participation of long-term basketball training influences interlimb difference and
also observed more accurate and more frequent usage of the non-dominant hand in
basketball players that can be explained by some kinematic variables during an
aiming task. METHODS: Professional right-handed female basketball players and
age-matched non-athletes were asked to reach one of three targets in a virtual
reality environment setup with either their non-dominant or dominant hand. Two
kinematic parameters depicting motor performance asymmetries were measured: accuracy
and hand path deviation from linearity (HPDL). RESULTS: No interlimb differences for
basketball players but significant asymmetrical performance for non-athletes were
observed. Although the aiming task used in this study is not a basketball specific
task, basketball players still displayed better performance compared to non-athletes
in both accuracy and HPDL. CONCLUSIONS: The current study implies that not only
sensorimotor information but also participation of long-term sports activity can
modify interlimb difference. Moreover, basketball players having symmetrical motor
performance of both hands, which was found in this study, can indirectly explain the
more frequent usage of the non-dominant left hand in basketball players.

31326742	Processing head fakes in basketball: Are there ironic effects of instructions on the	"Instructions in sports are used to improve athletes' performance. However, instructions can also impair performance if they direct athletes' attention to a
to-be-avoided behavior which paradoxically provokes exactly that behavior (ironic
effect). The present study investigates the impact of different instructions on the
head-fake effect in basketball. Specifically, we asked here if deliberate attempts
to ignore the deceptive cues gaze direction and head orientation increase the impact
of that information and thus, paradoxically increase the head-fake effect. We found
that the detrimental impact of spatially incongruent gaze direction and head
orientation was essentially independent of whether participants were, or were not,
instructed to deliberately ignore the task-irrelevant information. Hence, deceptive
actions exert their impact independent of the perceivers' attempts to ignore
deceptive cues. We thus conclude that the deceptive cues gaze direction and head
orientation are per se hyper-accessible or over-salient and its processing cannot be
controlled with any amount of mental capacity (and even not with the non-ironic
instruction). However, as both ignore instructions produce general processing costs
(i.e., slower reactions) coaches should solely instruct athletes' to focus attention
on the processing of the pass direction.

individual sports or groups of sports, but most pertain to specific age groups or
levels of competition. Research suggests that many sports that do not require
mouthguards should encourage male and female participants to use orofacial
protectors. Athletes, coaches, athletic directors, athletic trainers, parents, and
members of the dental community should be aware of how individuals who participate
in sporting activities are at risk for dental trauma. Any sport where the potential
for dental trauma can exist, such as basketball, soccer, or wrestling, should
consider utilizing mouthguards to protect the competitors. The establishment of
mouthguard programs for athletes of all ages and genders who participate in
basketball may help to reduce the incidence of dental trauma.

the WMP test 3 times in their own wheelchair: (i) without adjustments (""control
condition""); (ii) with 10 kg additional mass (""weighted condition""); and (iii) with
50% reduced tyre pressure (""tyre condition""). The outcome measure was time (s). If
paired t-tests were significant (p <0.05) and differences between conditions were
larger than the standard error of measurement, the effect sizes (ES) were used to
evaluate the sensitivity to change. ES values ≥0.2 were regarded as sensitive to
change. RESULTS: The overall performance times for the manipulations were
significantly higher than the control condition, with mean differences of 4.40 s
(weight - control, ES = 0.44) and 2.81 s (tyre - control, ES = 0.27). The overall
performance time on the WMP test was judged as sensitive to change. For 8 of the 15
separate tasks on the WMP test, the tasks were judged as sensitive to change for at
least one of the manipulations. CONCLUSION: The WMP test can detect change in
mobility performance when wheelchair configurations are manipulated.

29540107	Interdependent Tripartite Efficacy Perceptions and Individual Performance: Case	"Tripartite efficacy refers to the beliefs of the individuals within a dyad regarding personal abilities (self-efficacy), the partner's abilities (other-efficacy), or
relation-inferred self-efficacy. This efficacy model has recently gained popularity
in sports research (Jackson, Whipp, & Beauchamp, 2013), although there has not been
any longitudinal research on efficacy beliefs and performance within this complex
intra-dyad tripartite efficacy model. In a case study, we examined six individual
players on a high school basketball team to explore any longitudinal changes in
these tripartite efficacy beliefs through a season of play. On seven data collection
periods, players completed the Basketball-Tripartite Efficacy Measure, and their
game performance statistics were analyzed with an objective basketball individual
performance formula. We found similar variations between participants'
other-efficacy beliefs and the dyad partner's basketball performance score as well
as between self-efficacy and individual performance score. Observational data from
this case study lend some support to spiraling of self-efficacy and performance from
repeated successes or failures and to perceived efficacy-performance plateaus that
have been previously demonstrated in controlled experimental research. Importantly,
this study suggests the presence of other-efficacy beliefs in their relationship to
other-performance and to spiraling relationships between other-efficacy beliefs and
other-performance, which have not been demonstrated previously.

30126295	Determination of the exercise intensity corresponding with maximal lactate steady	"The purpose of the present study was to define the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS(meas)) in high-level male basketball players and to compare it with the
lactate turnpoint (LTP) and the respective point derived form a prediction method
(MLSS(cal)). Twelve high-level basketball players underwent one maximal and several
submaximal tests on a treadmill on different days where MLSS and LTP were measured.
MLSS(meas) was observed at 75% of the maximal treadmill speed, at 77% of VO(2max),
at 88% of HR(max) and at [La(-)] of 3.7 mmol.l(-1). No differences were observed
between MLSS(meas) and LTP in any of the measured variables. A good agreement was
observed between MLSS(meas) and LTP, as well as between MLSS(meas) and MLSS(cal).
Therefore, LTP and MLSS(cal) are offered as acceptable approaches to predict MLSS,
but not all the indices used to define MLSS presents high agreement between the
methods used.

28169152	Sleep patterns and match performance in elite Australian basketball athletes.	"OBJECTIVES: To assess sleep patterns and associations between sleep and match performance in elite Australian female basketball players. DESIGN: Prospective
cohort study. METHODS: Seventeen elite female basketball players were monitored
across two consecutive in-season competitions (30 weeks). Total sleep time and sleep
efficiency were determined using triaxial accelerometers for Baseline, Pre-match,
Match-day and Post-match timings. Match performance was determined using the
basketball efficiency statistic (EFF). The effects of match schedule (Regular versus
Double-Header; Home versus Away) and sleep on EFF were assessed. RESULTS: The
Double-Header condition changed the pattern of sleep when compared with the Regular
condition (F((3,48))=3.763, P=0.017), where total sleep time Post-match was 11% less
for Double-Header (mean±SD; 7.2±1.4h) compared with Regular (8.0±1.3h; P=0.007).
Total sleep time for Double-Header was greater Pre-match (8.2±1.7h) compared with
Baseline (7.1±1.6h; P=0.022) and Match-day (7.3±1.5h; P=0.007). Small correlations
existed between sleep metrics at Pre-match and EFF for pooled data (r=-0.39 to
-0.22; P≥0.238). Relationships between total sleep time and EFF ranged from moderate
negative to large positive correlations for individual players (r=-0.37 to 0.62) and
reached significance for one player (r=0.60; P=0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Match schedule
can affect the sleep patterns of elite female basketball players. A large degree of
inter-individual variability existed in the relationship between sleep and match
performance; nevertheless, sleep monitoring might assist in the optimisation of
performance for some athletes.

33(7): 1897-1903, 2019-The aim of this study was to compare the data obtained using
microsensor technology in 2 types of 5vs5 training games-the regular-stop game (RSG)
and the no-stop game (NSG)-and in match-play (MP) in elite basketball. Sixteen
top-level basketball players were monitored during pre- and in-season periods (10
weeks). The variables included: player load, accelerations (ACC), decelerations
(DEC), changes of direction (CoD), and jumps (JUMP)-all in both total (t) and
high-intensity (h) relative values (i.e., per minute of play): PLmin, ACCmin,
DECmin, CoDmin, and JUMPmin, respectively. Almost all variables showed trivial
difference between MP and RSG. The only variable that showed small difference was
tACCmin (MP > RSG). In case of RSG vs. NSG, 3 variables showed trivial
difference-tACCmin, hACCmin, and hDECmin, 3 (i.e., hCODmin, tDECmin, and PLmin)
small differences, and 3 (tCoDmin, tJUMPmin, and hJUMPmin) moderate differences (NSG
> RSG). In MP vs. NSG, 2 variables (hCoDmin and tACCmin) showed trivial differences;
variable hDECmin showed small difference, whereas the other 5 variables (tCoDmin,
tJUMPmin, hJUMPmin, tDECmin, and PLmin) showed moderate difference (NSG > MP). Only
one variable, hACCmin, showed moderate difference, when MP > NSG. The main
conclusion of the study was that by introducing some constraints into 5vs5 tasks,
the coaching staff could elicit higher physical demands than those occurring in MP.
By understanding the differences in demands of NSG, RSG, and MP, coaches in elite
basketball can improve their system of training drills selection, especially when
looking for optimal short-term tapering approach, leading up to the game day.

performance. Undergraduate sport and exercise science students (N = 102) were
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: prosocial behavior, antisocial behavior, and
control. They performed a basketball free-throw shooting task for 2 min in baseline
and experimental phases and completed measures of emotions and attention. Free-throw
shooting performance was also recorded. A series of analyses of covariances
controlling for baseline scores showed that the prosocial group reported more
happiness than the antisocial and control groups. The antisocial group reported more
anxiety than the prosocial group and more anger and lower attention than the other 2
groups. The prosocial and antisocial groups performed better than the control group.
These findings suggest that prosocial and antisocial teammate behaviors may
influence the recipient's emotions, attention, and performance during sport
competition.

31935773	Basketball Activity Classification Based on Upper Body Kinematics and Dynamic Time	"Basketball activity classification can help document players' statistics, allow coaches, trainers and the medical team to quantitatively supervise players' physical
exertion and optimize training strategy, and further help prevent potential
injuries. Traditionally, sports activity classification was done by manual
notational, or through multi-camera systems or motion sensing technology. These
methods were often erroneous and limited by space. This study presents a basketball
activity classification model based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and body kinematic
measures. Twenty participants, including 10 experienced players and 10 novice
players, were involved in an experimental study. The experienced and novice players
differed in their years of playing basketball. Four basketball movements, including
shooting, passing, dribbling, and lay-up were classified by kinematic measures. The
results indicate that the proposed model can successfully classify different
basketball movements with high accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, with the
resultant acceleration of the hand, this model can achieve classification precision,
recall, and specificity up to 0.984, 0.983 and 0.994, respectively. Findings from
this study supported the feasibility of using DTW in real-time sports activity
classification and provided insights into the optimal sensor placement for
basketball activity classification applications.

27197090	Cumulative Training Dose's Effects on Interrelationships Between Common	"PURPOSE: The influence of various factors on training-load (TL) responses in basketball has received limited attention. This study aimed to examine the temporal
changes and influence of cumulative training dose on TL responses and
interrelationships during basketball activity. METHODS: Ten state-level Australian
male junior basketball players completed 4 × 10-min standardized bouts of simulated
basketball activity using a circuit-based protocol. Internal TL was quantified using
the session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE), summated heart-rate zones (SHRZ),
Banister training impulse (TRIMP), and Lucia TRIMP models. External TL was assessed
via measurement of mean sprint and circuit speeds. Temporal TL comparisons were
performed between 10-min bouts, while Pearson correlation analyses were conducted
across cumulative training doses (0-10, 0-20, 0-30, and 0-40 min). RESULTS: sRPE TL
increased (P < .05) after the first 10-min bout of basketball activity. sRPE TL was
only significantly related to Lucia TRIMP (r = .66-.69; P < .05) across 0-10 and
0-20 min. Similarly, mean sprint and circuit speed were significantly correlated
across 0-20 min (r = .67; P < .05). In contrast, SHRZ and Banister TRIMP were
significantly related across all training doses (r = .84-.89; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS:
Limited convergence exists between common TL approaches across basketball training
doses lasting beyond 20 min. Thus, the interchangeability of commonly used internal
and external TL approaches appears dose-dependent during basketball activity, with
various psychophysiological mediators likely underpinning temporal changes.

players. This study aimed to quantify in-shoe plantar pressure profiles in amateur
players when executing typical basketball movements. METHODS: Twenty male university
basketball players performed four basketball-specific movement tasks-running,
maximal forward sprinting, maximal 45° cutting, and layup-in a pair of standardized
basketball shoes fitted with an in-shoe plantar pressure measurement system. Peak
pressure (PP) and pressure-time integral (PTI) data were extracted from ten plantar
regions. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed across the
tasks, with significance set at P < .05. RESULTS: Distinct plantar pressure
distribution patterns were observed among the four movements. Compared with running,
significantly higher ( P < .05) PP and PTI of up to approximately 55% were found in
sprinting and layup, particularly at the forefoot region. Similarly, significantly
higher ( P < .05) PPs and PTIs, ranging from approximately 23% to 90%, were observed
in 45° cutting compared with running at most foot regions. CONCLUSIONS: Compared
with running, sprinting and layup demonstrated higher plantar loading in the
forefoot region, and 45° cutting yielded increased plantar loading in most regions
of the foot. Understanding the plantar pressure characteristics of different
movements may be useful in optimizing footwear designs, orthosis use, or training
strategies to minimize regional plantar loading during amateur basketball play.

25310027	Hand preference patterns in expert basketball players: interrelations between	"In the present study we examined the interrelation of everyday life handedness and hand preference in basketball, as an area of expertise that requires individuals
being proficient with both their non-dominant and dominant hand. A secondary aim was
to elucidate the link between basketball-specific practice, hand preference in
basketball and everyday life handedness. Therefore, 176 expert basketball players
self-reported their hand preference for activities of daily living and for
basketball-specific behavior as well as details about their basketball-specific
history via questionnaire. We found that compared to the general population the
one-hand bias was significantly reduced for both everyday life and
basketball-specific hand preference (i.e., a higher prevalence of mixed-handed
individuals), and that both concepts were significantly related. Moreover, only
preference scores for lay-up and dribbling skills were significantly related to
measures of basketball-specific practice. Consequently, training-induced modulations
of lateral preference seem to be very specific to only a few basketball-specific
skills, and do not generalize to other skills within the domain of basketball nor do
they extend into everyday life handedness. The results are discussed in terms of
their relevance regarding theories of handedness and their practical implications
for the sport of basketball.

population at risk for patellar tendinopathy. J Strength Cond Res 30(7): 1834-1842,
2016-Volleyball and basketball players can be considered as a population at risk for
patellar tendinopathy. Given the paradox that eccentric training elicits therapeutic
benefits yet might provoke such injury, we investigated the influence of a weekly
bout of inertial squat resistance exercise offering eccentric overload on lower limb
muscle power and patellar tendon complaints. Players of 8 (4 basketball and 4
volleyball) teams (38 women and 43 men) were randomly assigned to either the
intervention (IG) or control (CG) group. Although IG and CG maintained scheduled
in-season training routines over 24 weeks, IG, in addition, performed 1 weekly
session of eccentric overload by 4 sets of 8 repetitions of the squat using flywheel
inertial resistance. Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment patellar tendinopathy
questionnaire (VISA-p), vertical countermovement jump, and squat power, both
concentric (Squat-Con) and eccentric (Squat-Ecc), tests were performed before (T1),
during (T2), and after (T3) the 24 weeks of intervention. Neither group suffered
from patellar tendinopathy during the study period. VISA-p displayed no differences
across groups at any measurement period. Countermovement jump scores significantly
(p ≤ 0.05) differed between groups in favor of the IG. Both Squat-Con and Squat-Ecc
mean scores from the IG were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than the CG. Adding a
weekly eccentric overload squat training bout to a regular basketball and volleyball
exercise routine enhances lower limb muscle power without triggering patellar tendon
complaints. Future studies, using the current exercise paradigm, aim to explore its
efficacy to prevent or combat patellar tendinopathy in sports calling for frequent
explosive jumps.

31046653	Reliability of Teams' Game-Related Statistics in Basketball: Number of Games	"In basketball, game-related statistics are the most common measure of performance. However, the literature assessing their reliability is scarce. Purpose: Analyze the
number of games required to obtain a good relative and absolute reliability of
teams' game-related statistics. Method: A total of 884 games from the 2015-2016 to
2017-2018 seasons of the Spanish men's professional league were analyzed using all
games and clustered by scoring difference. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)
was calculated for each variable. The number of games required to detect a change
and to achieve good relative reliability was calculated using minimal detectable
change and Spearman-Brown prophecy formula respectively. Results: Using all games,
the results showed that the minimal number of games required in each group was 30 to
detect a medium change (d > .5), 187 for a small change (d > .2), and 100 for good
relative reliability (ICC ≥ .75). Using balanced and unbalanced games, the minimal
number of games required in each group was respectively 31 and 30 to detect a medium
change (d > .5), 190 and 188 for a small change (d > .2), and 191 and 121 for good
relative reliability (ICC ≥ .75). Conclusions: The sample needs to consist of at
least 30 games in each group to detect a medium size change, and at least 190 games
to detect a small size change. To be able to rank teams with good reliability, at
least 100 games are required when including both balanced and unbalanced games.

Twelve professional basketball players were tested before the 2012-13 season. Visual
tracking speed was obtained from 1 core session (20 trials) of the multiple object
tracking test, whereas RT was measured by fixed- and variable-region choice reaction
tests, using a light-based testing device. Performance in VTS and RT was compared
with basketball-specific measures of performance (assists [AST]; turnovers [TO];
assist-to-turnover ratio [AST/TO]; steals [STL]) during the regular basketball
season. All performance measures were reported per 100 minutes played. Performance
differences between backcourt (guards; n = 5) and frontcourt (forward/centers; n =
7) positions were also examined. Relationships were most likely present between VTS
and AST (r = 0.78; p < 0.003), STL (r = 0.77; p < 0.003), and AST/TO (r = 0.78; p <
0.003), whereas a likely relationship was also observed with TO (r = 0.49; p <
0.109). Reaction time was not related to any of the basketball-specific performance
measures. Backcourt players were most likely to outperform frontcourt players in AST
and very likely to do so for VTS, TO, and AST/TO. In conclusion, VTS seems to be
related to a basketball player's ability to see and respond to various stimuli on
the basketball court that results in more positive plays as reflected by greater
number of AST and STL and lower turnovers.

trials necessary to establish a stable mean for plantar loading variables during the
lay-up. Thirteen university male basketball players [age: 23.0 (1.4) years, height:
1.75 (0.05) m, mass: 68.4 (8.6) kg] performed ten successful basketball lay-ups from
a stationary position. Plantar loading variables were recorded using the Novel
Pedar-X in-shoe system. Loading variables including peak force, peak pressure, and
pressure-time integral were extracted from eight foot regions. Performance stability
of plantar loading variables during the take-off and landing steps were assessed
using the sequential averaging technique and intra-class correlation coefficient
(ICC). High plantar loadings were experienced at the heel during the take-off steps,
and both the heel and forefoot regions upon landing. The sequential estimation
technique revealed a five-eight trial range to achieve a stable mean across all
plantar loading variables, whereas ICC analysis was insensitive to inter-trial
differences of repeated lay-up performances. Future studies and performance
evaluation protocols on plantar loading during basketball lay-ups should include at

31479399	External Activity Demands Differ Between Referees and Players During a Sub-Elite,	"Match activity demands of basketball players have been well reported but little exists in terms of quantifying the demands encountered by referees during
match-play. Potential differences between referees and players may identify
different fitness capacities and subsequent need for different training regimes.
Purpose: The aims of this brief report were to: 1) document the activity demands of
sub-elite basketball referees during a match; and 2) compare referee and player
match activity demands. Method: Three referees and six players participating in the
same sub-elite, basketball match were monitored for external activity (PlayerLoad™,
PL) via microsensor technology. The proportion of each quarter and entire match time
spent in pre-set PL bands was also examined to develop PL profiles. Differences in
activity demands between referees and players were calculated using effect size (ES)
analyses (± 95% confidence intervals). Results: Referees experienced an absolute PL
of 310 ± 28 arbitrary units (4.2 ± 0.4 AU.min(-1)) during the match which was ~40%
lower than that of the players (ES = 1.14; -0.45, 2.48). Referees exhibited a match
PL profile dominated by the lowest PL band (~91%) with the players' PL profile
shifted slightly towards higher bands. Conclusion: Sub-elite basketball referees
experienced activity demands substantially lower than that of players during the
same match. Limited movement patterns due to recommended court positioning may have
contributed to the lower PL of referees. Differences in PL between referees and
players highlight a need to develop specific training regimes to focus on key
fitness capacities for each match role.

26439783	Basketball Performance Is Related to Maturity and Relative Age in Elite Adolescent	"During a national championship, the anthropometric, physiological, and maturation characteristics of 13- to 14-year-old players of elite basketball teams and their
association with sport performance were analyzed. Body parameters (weight, height,
skinfold thicknesses, and lengths) were measured and physiological capacities
assessed by sprint (20 m) and jump tests (i.e., countermovement jump with arm
swing). Chronological age (CA) and maturity offset (years from age at peak height
velocity; YAPHV) were calculated, and then predicted age at peak height velocity, as
the difference between CA and YAPHV. Game performance was assessed with point
averages and the performance index rating (PIR). The birth-date distribution of
players was biased, those born early in the selection year outnumbering those born
later. Anthropometric analysis indicated that players who performed better had
longer body lengths. Physiological testing showed that semi-finalists had better
sprint performance than quarter-finalists and those players with greater jump
capacity scored more points. Early maturation and advanced maturity status were also
associated with better PIR and scored points per game. Multiple blockwise regression
analysis showed that, among the factors analyzed, YAPHV was the best predictor of
basketball performance. In conclusion, around puberty, physical and physiological
parameters associated with maturity and CA are important in determining the success
of elite basketball players. Consequently, boys who are born in the second half of
the year and/or late maturing tend to be marginalized or totally excluded, and not
given the chance to play under equal conditions; their careers may then be held back
by the relative disadvantage associated with inexperience.

to examine the nature of the stressors team sport athletes appraised during games at
individual and team levels, as well as their degree of synchronization during an
unfolding game. Through individual self-confrontation interviews, the activities of
nine basketball players of the same team were examined in detail. The results
revealed that 12 categories of stressors were reported, and categorized into two
larger units reflecting stressors perceived as affecting (a) ""the team functioning
as a whole"" and (b) ""a player's own functioning"". Thus, the nature and degree of
similarity of the game-specific stressors experienced by basketball players within a
single team were identified during a game. In addition, the findings showed six
different patterns of synchronizations of team members' stressors, as well as their
changes over the course of the game. They provided support for the synchronized
appraisal and experience of stressors within a team during a game. By adopting an
interpersonal perspective and examining the temporal interplay in team members'
activities, this study shed light on stress within teams.

18557659	Design and interpretation of anthropometric and fitness testing of basketball	"The volume of literature on fitness testing in court sports such as basketball is considerably less than for field sports or individual sports such as running and
cycling. Team sport performance is dependent upon a diverse range of qualities
including size, fitness, sport-specific skills, team tactics, and psychological
attributes. The game of basketball has evolved to have a high priority on body size
and physical fitness by coaches and players. A player's size has a large influence
on the position in the team, while the high-intensity, intermittent nature of the
physical demands requires players to have a high level of fitness. Basketball
coaches and sport scientists often use a battery of sport-specific physical tests to
evaluate body size and composition, and aerobic fitness and power. This testing may
be used to track changes within athletes over time to evaluate the effectiveness of
training programmes or screen players for selection. Sports science research is
establishing typical (or 'reference') values for both within-athlete changes and
between-athlete differences. Newer statistical approaches such as magnitude-based
inferences have emerged that are providing more meaningful interpretation of fitness
testing results in the field for coaches and athletes. Careful selection and
implementation of tests, and more pertinent interpretation of data, will enhance the
value of fitness testing in high-level basketball programmes. This article presents
reference values of fitness and body size in basketball players, and identifies
practical methods of interpreting changes within players and differences between
players beyond the null-hypothesis.

30724705	Especial skill vs. quiet eye duration in basketball free throw: Evidence for the	"The quiet eye (QE) is a gaze phenomenon that has been studied over more than two decades. However, the underlying mechanisms of the well-known expertise effect,
namely, longer QE durations in experts when compared to less-skilled athletes remain
unclear. Therefore, from a functional perspective, an inhibition hypothesis was
proposed that explains long QE durations in experts with increased inhibition
requirements over movement parametrisation. This hypothesis was tested by making use
of the especial-skill effect in basketball free throw which refers to the
observation of higher actual performance than would be predicted on the basis of
performance at the nearby locations. In line with the expectations, from the
distance of the free-throw line, higher actual than predicted shooting accuracy and
longer actual than predicted QE duration were revealed. This suggests that when
performing free throws prolonged QE durations are required to shield the optimal
against alternative task solutions within the very dense sub-space of this especial
skill. These findings suggest an inhibition function of long QE durations in expert
athletes.

25529051	Metabolic optimisation of the basketball free throw.	"The free throw (FT) is a fundamental basketball skill used frequently during a match. Most of actual play occurs at about 85% of maximum heart rate (HR). Metabolic
intensity, through fatigue, may influence a technically skilled move as the FT is.
Twenty-eight under 17 basketball players were studied while shooting FTs on a
regular indoor basketball court. We investigated FT accuracy in young male
basketball players shooting at three different HRs: at rest, at 50% and at 80% of
maximum experimentally obtained HR value. We found no significant FT percentage
difference between rest and 50% of the maximum HR (FT percentage about 80%;
P > 0.05). Differently, at 80% of the maximum HR the FT percentage decreased
significantly by more than 20% (P < 0.001) down to about 60%. No preliminary warm-up
is needed before entering game for the FT accuracy. Furthermore, we speculate that
time-consuming, cooling-off routines usually performed by shooters before each FT
may be functional to improve its accuracy.

25908013	Individual recovery profiles in basketball players.	"In the sport context, recovery has been characterized as a multifactor process (physiological, psychological, behavioral, social, etc.). This study takes a
multidisciplinary approach to find psychophysiological markers of the
stress-recovery process. It aims to determine how athletes' specific recovery
actions relate to their perceptions of recovery, and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). A
total of 196 assessments were analyzed from 6 players on a men's professional
basketball team within the Liga LEB Oro basketball federation (2012/2013 season).
Perceptions of recovery, recovery strategies, and HRV were recorded. The results
show a pattern of individual differences in behavior related to athletes' recovery
actions and HRV profiles throughout the season (p < .05). Moreover, we observed that
each player had different recovery needs. In light of these results, we suggest an
individualistic approach to evaluating and monitoring recovery to attend more
accurately to each player's recovery needs.

28604286	Growth, functional capacities and motivation for achievement and competitiveness in	"The interaction of multiple influences on the path to sport success is not yet fully understood by sport scientists. In this study, we examined variation in body size,
functional capacities and motivation for achievement, competitiveness and deliberate
practice of youth basketball players associated with differences in biological
maturity status, chronological age and years of training experience. Reflecting the
importance of interactive effects, we examined the relationships between the
psychological variables and functional capacities. Fifty-eight male basketball
players aged 9.5 to 15.5 years were considered. Variables included chronological
age, estimated age at peak height velocity, stature, body mass and sitting height by
anthropometry; the Work and Family Orientation and Deliberate Practice Motivation
Questionnaires were also used. Finally, the Line Drill test and Yo-Yo Intermittent
Recovery level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) tests were used as functional capacities indicators for
basketball. Variance components models derived from series of multilevel linear
regression models revealed a substantial variation by maturity status for body size,
functional capacities indicators, mastery and will to excel. The influence of
estimated maturity status on mastery and will to excel was independent of age and
years of experience. In contrast, no relationships were observed between
psychological variables and functional capacities indicators. We conclude that
growth-related changes are relevant to understanding players´ motivations for
achievement, competitiveness and deliberate practice. This should be of interest to
those involved in the selection and development of youth basketball players.

30569768	Maturational Development as a Key Aspect in Physiological Performance and	"PURPOSE: To determine the discriminators as variables to select the under-16 national-team players and to examine the influence of biological age on
physical/technical parameters among young basketball players. METHODS: Thirty-four
under-15 male basketball players performed several anthropometrical (height,
wingspan, body mass, and fingers length) and physical (jumping, sprinting, throwing,
flexibility, change-of-direction speed, and aerobic fitness) tests during the
under-15 male national-team training camp. Maturity offset, lower-limb asymmetry
index, and power outputs for jumping and sprinting were also computed. In addition,
game performance was taken into consideration using game-related statistics
(assists, turnovers, steals, rebounds, blocks, and points) of 5 games of during the
previous regional tournament (April 2016). Cluster analysis was used to analyze the
between-maturation status (prepubertal, pubertal, and postpubertal) differences in
physical parameters. RESULTS: The postpubertals showed a significantly better
performance in power outputs (jumping and sprinting), throwing abilities, and
blocks, whereas prepubertal performed significantly better in aerobic fitness and
assists. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve confirmed maturational status (area
under the curve [AUC] = 0.804; P < .05) and training experience (AUC = 0.789; P <
.05) as the most important attributes in predicting under-16 national-team
selection. Players with more than 5.5 years of training experience and less than
1.4 y to the age at peak height velocity were most likely to be selected.
CONCLUSION: Maturational status seems to be a key variable that increases the
probability of selection for the Portuguese under-16 national team.

23578258	Offensive tactical thinking level of wheelchair basketball players in Arab	"The purpose of this study was to assess the appropriateness of offensive tactical decision-making of Arab basketball players, and to determine if there are
differences in the appropriateness of offensive tactical decision-making within the
various disability classifications of Arab basketball players. A twenty-question
survey was formulated to assess decision-making in offensive tactical situations in
wheelchair basketball players. Participants in the present study were 108 athletes
from 10 Arab national teams participating in wheelchair basketball. The mean
offensive tactical thinking level of wheelchair basketball players in the 20
different situations in the Arab countries ranged between 1.38-2.84, and the
standard deviations for these 20 means ranged from 0.41 to 0.90. The total mean of
all tactical situations was 2.33, which is moderate thinking level. The influence of
the disability classification on the offensive tactical thinking of wheelchair
basketball players was addressed by examining the data via a one-way ANOVA. The
ANOVA revealed no significant differences among disability
classifications/categories in tactical thinking (F(3, 104)=1.12, p=0.34). This study
represents the first attempt to identify why Arab nations have not consistently
qualified for the Paralympics or World Championships. These findings indicate that
the moderate offensive tactical thinking level of wheelchair basketball players on
Arab national teams may be part of the reason that performances of these teams have
not been as strong as they would like.

113 wheelchair basketball players in the super and first Turkish leagues.
INTERVENTIONS: A modified Wheelchair Skills Test (WST) (version 4.1) was used to
evaluate trunk stabilization. Two skills were chosen that correspond to the
stationary wheelie activity in WST, the 30-s stationary wheelie and stationary
wheelie in 180°. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: There are no statistical differences between
WST rates and point means. RESULTS: The skills and success and safety rates of the
players with 1.5 points (51.9%, 44.4%) were lower than those of the players with 1.0
point (70%, 66.7%). In players with 2.5 and 2.0 points, the most successful and
safest percentage values were 78.6%, 78.6% and 82.1%, 75%. CONCLUSIONS: Although it
is expected that trunk stabilization would be better in players with high points, in
our study we encountered conflicting results between the points and sitting balance
or trunk stabilization. Our study supports the studies in the literature suggesting
modifications in the functional-classification system.

26284807	Position-Dependent Cardiovascular Response and Time-Motion Analysis During Training	"The purpose of this study was to measure differences in the cardiovascular workload (heart rate [HR]) and time-motion demands between positional groups, during numerous
basketball training drills, and compare the results with in-game competition
demands. A convenience sample of 14 top-level professional basketball players from
the same club (Spanish First Division, ACB) participated in the study. A total of
146 basketball exercises per player (performed over an 8-week period in 32 team
training sessions throughout the competitive season) and 7 friendly matches (FM)
played during the preparatory phase were analyzed. The results reveal that HRavg and
HRpeak were the highest in FM (158 ± 10; 198 ± 9 b · min(-1), respectively).
Time-motion analysis showed 1v1 to be the most demanding drill (53 ± 8 and 46 ± 12
movements per minute for full and half court, respectively). During FM, players
performed 33 ± 7 movements per minute. Positional differences exist for both HR and
time-motion demands, ranging from moderate to very large for all basketball drills
compared with FM. Constraints such as number of players, court size, work-to-rest
ratios, and coach intervention are key factors influencing cardiovascular responses
and time-motion demands during basketball training sessions. These results
demonstrate that systematic monitoring of the physical demands and physiological
responses during training and competition can inform and potentially improve
coaching strategy, basketball-specific training drills, and ultimately, match
performance.

performance. 15 university basketball players wore customized shoes with different
collar heights (high and low) and heel counter-stiffness (regular, stiffer and

athletic performance evaluated in jumping and agility tasks. All variables were
analysed using two-way repeated ANOVA. Results showed shorter time to peak ankle
inversion for both high collar and stiff heel counter conditions (P < 0.05), while
smaller initial ankle inversion angle, peak inversion velocity and total range of
inversion for wearing high collar shoes (P < 0.05). No shoe differences were found
for performance variables. These findings imply that the collar height might play a
larger role in lateral stability than heel counter-stiffness, while both collar
height and counter-stiffness have no effect on athletic performance.

25561579	Gender-specific activity demands experienced during semiprofessional basketball game	"PURPOSE: To compare game activity demands between female and male semiprofessional basketball players. METHODS: Female (n=12) and male (n=12) semiprofessional
basketball players were monitored across 3 competitive games. Time-motion-analysis
procedures quantified player activity into predefined movement categories across
backcourt (BC) and frontcourt (FC) positions. Activity frequencies, durations, and
distances were calculated relative to live playing time (min). Work:rest ratios were
also calculated using the video data. Game activity was compared between genders for
each playing position and all players. RESULTS: Female players performed at greater
running work-rates than male players (45.7±1.4 vs. 42.1±1.7 m/min, P=.05), while
male players performed more dribbling than female players (2.5±0.3 vs. 3.0±0.2
s/min; 8.4±0.3 vs. 9.7±0.7 m/min, P=.05). Positional analyses revealed that female
BC players performed more low-intensity shuffling (P=.04) and jumping (P=.05), as
well as longer (P=.04) jogging durations, than male BC players. Female FC players
executed more upper-body activity (P=.03) and larger work:rest ratios (P<.001) than
male FC players. No significant gender differences were observed in the overall
intermittent demands, distance traveled, high-intensity shuffling activity, and
sprinting requirements during game play. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that
gender-specific running and dribbling differences might exist in semiprofessional
basketball. Furthermore, position-specific variations between female and male
basketball players should be considered. These data may prove useful in the
development of gender-specific conditioning plans relative to playing position in
basketball.

height from sub-maximal to maximal efforts. Lower extremity joint kinematics and
kinetics were recorded as 11 male, NCAA Division I basketball players performed 8-10
CMJ across effort levels of approximately 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. Simple correlation
models were used to investigate the associations between effort levels (i.e., CMJ
height) and joint mechanics (i.e., negative (eccentric) and positive (concentric)
mechanical work performed at the hip, knee, and ankle joints) for each individual
player and the entire group. Group-analyses showed that increases in all joint
mechanical variables were associated with increases in CMJ height. In contrast,
single-subject analyses revealed that players used individualised strategies, and
selectively scaled the magnitude of mechanical work at none (n = 2), one (n = 2),
two (n = 5), or all three (n = 2) joints as they increased CMJ efforts. In addition,
individual players also appeared to selectively scale different combinations of
eccentric or concentric joint work as they increased CMJ height. These results
highlight that male basketball players use joint-specific strategies to increase CMJ
height when progressively increasing CMJ effort.

performance in precision tasks. To date, research only addressed this phenomenon in
situations without adversarial constraints. In the present study, we compared the
quiet-eye behaviour of intermediately-skilled and highly-skilled basketball players
in defended vs. undefended game situations. We predicted differences in quiet-eye
duration as a function of skill and performance particularly resulting from late
quiet-eye offsets. Results indicated performance-enhancing effects of long quiet-eye
durations in the defended but not in the undefended game situation. Furthermore, in
line with our prediction, later quiet-eye offsets were associated with superior
performance elucidating the phenomenon's relevance in online-demanding motor tasks.
Further, earlier quiet-eye onsets were linked to successful performance supporting
earlier suggestions that it is not only the duration but also the timing that
matters. These findings not only extend the positive effects of the quiet eye in
motor performance to dynamic game-play situations but also support the role of the
quiet eye in response to programming and information processing respectively.

primary aim was to quantify relationships between 2D:4D and game-related statistics
in semi-professional female basketball players. The secondary aim was to quantify
the differences in mean 2D:4Ds between players based on their position in the
starting lineup. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, 64 female basketball
players who competed in the South Australian Premier League were measured in-season
for height, mass, and 2D:4D, with game-related statistics collected end-season.
Partial correlations (adjusted for age and body mass index) were used to quantify
relationships between right and left 2D:4Ds and game-related statistics. Unpaired
t-tests were used to quantify differences in mean 2D:4Ds between starting and
reserve players. RESULTS: 2D:4D was a substantial negative correlate of blocks,
rebounds, and field-goal percentage; meaning, females with lower 2D:4Ds were
generally better defensively as they recorded more blocks and rebounds, and were
more efficient scorers, irrespective of their age and body size. Mean 2D:4D differed
by position in the starting lineup, as females with lower 2D:4Ds were more likely to
be in the starting lineup. CONCLUSIONS: This study found evidence that 2D:4D was a
correlate of performance in an open-skill sport. Female players with lower digit
ratios tended to perform better in several aspects of basketball, especially
defensively, and were more likely to be starters, suggesting they are the best
players on the team in their positions. These results probably reflect the
organizational benefits of prenatal testosterone.

To mimic mobility performance of wheelchair basketball matches in a standardised
manner, a test was designed based on observation of wheelchair basketball matches
and expert judgement. Forty-six players performed the test to determine its validity
and 23 players performed the test twice for reliability. Independent-samples t-tests
were used to assess whether the times needed to complete the test were different for
classifications, playing standards and sex. Intraclass correlation coefficients
(ICC) were calculated to quantify reliability of performance times. Males performed
better than females (P < 0.001, effect size [ES] = -1.26) and international men
performed better than national men (P < 0.001, ES = -1.62). Performance time of low

moderate ES (P = 0.06, ES = 0.58). The reliability was excellent for overall
performance time (ICC = 0.95). These results show that the test can be used as a
standardised mobility performance test to validly and reliably assess the capacity
in mobility performance of elite wheelchair basketball athletes. Furthermore, the
described methodology of development is recommended for use in other sports to

32134965	Training load and match-play demands in basketball based on competition level: A	"Basketball is a court-based team-sport that requires a broad array of demands (physiological, mechanical, technical, tactical) in training and competition which
makes it important for practitioners to understand the stress imposed on the
basketball player during practice and match-play. Therefore, the main aim of the
present systematic review is to investigate the training and match-play demands of
basketball in elite, sub-elite, and youth competition. A search of five electronic
databases (PubMed, SportDiscus, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Cochrane) was conducted
until December 20th, 2019. Articles were included if the study: (i) was published in
English; (ii) contained internal or external load variables from basketball training
and/or competition; and (iii) reported physiological or metabolic demands of
competition or practice. Additionally, studies were classified according to the type
of study participants into elite (20), sub-elite (9), and youth (6). A total of 35
articles were included in the systematic review. Results indicate that higher-level
players seem to be more efficient while moving on-court. When compared to sub-elite
and youth, elite players cover less distance at lower average velocities and with
lower maximal and average heart rate during competition. However, elite-level
players have a greater bandwidth to express higher velocity movements. From the
present systematic review, it seems that additional investigation on this topic is
warranted before a ""clear picture"" can be drawn concerning the acceleration and
deceleration demands of training and competition. It is necessary to accurately and
systematically assess competition demands to provide appropriate training strategies
that resemble match-play.

selected to maximise movement performance. Therefore, the purpose of the study was
to investigate the influence of basketball shoe mass, outsole traction, and forefoot
bending stiffness on sprinting, jumping, and cutting performance. Each of these
three basketball shoe properties was systematically varied by ± 20% to produce three
shoe conditions of varying mass, three conditions of varying traction, and three
conditions of varying bending stiffness. Each shoe was tested by 20 recreational
basketball players completing maximal effort sprints, vertical jumps, and a cutting
drill. Outsole traction had the largest influence on performance, as the
participants performed significantly worse in all tests when traction was decreased
by 20% (p < 0.001), and performed significantly better in the cutting drill when
traction was increased by 20% (p = 0.005). Forefoot bending stiffness had a moderate
effect on sprint and cutting performance (p = 0.013 and p = 0.016 respectively) and
shoe mass was found to have no effect on performance. Therefore, choosing a shoe
with relatively high outsole traction and forefoot bending stiffness should be
prioritised, and less concern should be focused on selecting the lightest shoe.

[10.1±4.9 vs 17.3±10.2ƞmolL(-1)], MM [13.0±7.4 vs 21.5±8.3ƞmolL(-1)], and HM
[18.9±5.8 vs 31.4±5.3ƞmolL(-1)] (p<0.05). A higher PRE-C was observed for the HM,
compared to TS and EM (p<0.05) and a higher POST-C concentration for the HM was
detected, compared to the TS, EM, and MM (p<0.05). A lower anxiety level was
observed for the EM (somatic: 15.0±3.7; cognitive: 15.8±4.5 arbitrary units [AU])
compared, to the MM (somatic: 16.4±3.5; cognitive: 17.7±4.0AU) and HM (somatic:
15.8±3.9; cognitive: 18.3±3.9AU) (p<0.05) and a higher self-confidence was observed
for the TS (28.9±5.1AU), compared to the HM (26.7±3.0AU) (p<0.05). These results
suggest that playing against a high-level opponent may cause a higher
psychobiological stress, likely because opponent level may be perceived as threating
to the social status in a given hierarchy.

19774373	Basketball injuries in children.	"Basketball is a popular, worldwide sport played outdoors and indoors year-round. Patterns of injury are related to abrupt changes in the athlete's direction,
jumping, contact between athletes, the hard playing surface and paucity of
protective equipment. Intensity of play and training in the quest of scholarships
and professional careers is believed to contribute to an increasing occurrence of
injury. Radiologists' appreciation of the breadth of injury and its relation to
imaging and clinical findings should enhance the care of these children. Some of the
patterns of injury are well known to radiologists but vary due to age- and
size-related changes; the growing skeleton is affected by differing susceptibilities
from biomechanical stresses at different sizes. Beyond screening radiographs, the
accuracy of MRI and CT has improved diagnosis and treatment plans in this realm.
Investigations to detect symptoms and signs in an attempt to prevent the tragedy of
sudden cardiac death in basketball players may lead to MRI and CTA studies that
compel radiologists to evaluate cardiac function along with myocardial and coronary
artery anatomy. Worthy of mention also is the female athlete triad of disordered
eating, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis that is observed in some young women
participating in this and other sports.

28537791	Mental Rotation of Tactical Instruction Displays Affects Information Processing	"PURPOSE: In sports games, coaches often use tactic boards to present tactical instructions during time-outs (e.g., 20 s to 60 s in basketball). Instructions
should be presented in a way that enables fast and errorless information processing
for the players. The aim of this study was to test the effect of different
orientations of visual tactical displays on observation time and execution
performance. High affordances in visual-spatial transformation (e.g., mental
rotation processes) might impede information processing and might decrease execution
performance with regard to the instructed playing patterns. METHOD: In a
within-subjects design with 1 factor, 10 novice students were instructed with visual
tactical instructions of basketball playing patterns with different orientations
either showing the playing pattern with low spatial disparity to the players'
on-court perspective (basket on top) or upside down (basket on bottom). RESULTS: The
self-chosen time for watching the pattern before execution was significantly shorter
and spatial accuracy in pattern execution was significantly higher when the
instructional perspective and the real perspective on the basketball court had a
congruent orientation. CONCLUSION: The effects might be explained by interfering
mental rotation processes that are necessary to transform the instructional
perspective into the players' actual perspective while standing on the court or
imagining themselves standing on the court. According to these results, coaches
should align their tactic boards to their players' on-court viewing perspective.

27347867	Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Asymptomatic Knees in Collegiate Basketball Players:	"OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of abnormal structural findings using 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the asymptomatic knees of male and female
collegiate basketball players before and after a season of high-intensity
basketball. DESIGN: Institutional review board-approved prospective case series.
PARTICIPANTS: Asymptomatic knees of 24 NCAA Division I collegiate basketball players
(12 male, 12 female) were imaged using a 3.0-T MRI scanner before and after the end
of the competitive season. Three subjects did not undergo scanning after the season.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Images were evaluated for prepatellar bursitis, fat pad
edema, patellar and quadriceps tendinopathy, bone marrow edema, and articular
cartilage and meniscal injury. RESULTS: Every knee imaged had at least 1 structural
abnormality both preseason and postseason. A high preseason and postseason
prevalence of fat pad edema (75% and 81%), patellar tendinopathy (83% and 90%), and
quadriceps tendinopathy (75% and 90%) was seen. Intrameniscal signal change was
observed in 50% preseason knees and 62% of postseason knees, but no discrete tears
were found. Bone marrow edema was seen in 75% and 86% of knees in the preseason and
postseason, respectively. Cartilage findings were observed in 71% and 81% of knees
in the preseason and postseason, respectively. The cartilage injury score increased
significantly in the postseason compared with the preseason (P = 0.0009).
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of abnormal knee MRI findings was observed in a
population of asymptomatic young elite athletes. These preliminary data suggest that
high-intensity basketball may have potentially deleterious effects on articular
cartilage.

28113142	Court Reconstruction for Camera Calibration in Broadcast Basketball Videos.	"We introduce a technique of calibrating camera motions in basketball videos. Our method particularly transforms player positions to standard basketball court
coordinates and enables applications such as tactical analysis and semantic
basketball video retrieval. To achieve a robust calibration, we reconstruct the
panoramic basketball court from a video, followed by warping the panoramic court to
a standard one. As opposed to previous approaches, which individually detect the
court lines and corners of each video frame, our technique considers all video
frames simultaneously to achieve calibration; hence, it is robust to illumination
changes and player occlusions. To demonstrate the feasibility of our technique, we
present a stroke-based system that allows users to retrieve basketball videos. Our
system tracks player trajectories from broadcast basketball videos. It then
rectifies the trajectories to a standard basketball court by using our camera
calibration method. Consequently, users can apply stroke queries to indicate how the
players move in gameplay during retrieval. The main advantage of this interface is
an explicit query of basketball videos so that unwanted outcomes can be prevented.
We show the results in Figs. 1, 7, 9, 10 and our accompanying video to exhibit the
feasibility of our technique.

24197721	The influence of visual contextual information on the emergence of the especial	"We examined whether basketball throwing performance in general and motor skill specificity from the free throw distance in particular are influenced by visual
contextual information. Experienced basketball players (N = 36) performed basketball
set shots at five distances from the basket. Of particular interest was the
performance from the free throw distance (4.23 m), at which experienced basketball
players are expected to show superior performance compared with nearby locations as
a result of massive amounts of practice. Whereas a control group performed the shots
on a regular basketball court, the distance between the rim and the free throw line
was either increased or decreased by 30 cm in two experimental groups. Findings
showed that only the control group had a superior performance from the free throw
distance, and the experimental groups did not. Moreover, all groups performed more
accurately from the perceived free throw line (independent of its location) compared
with nearby locations. The findings suggest that visual context information
influences the presence of specificity effects in experienced performers. The
findings have theoretical implications for explaining the memory representation
underlying the especial skill effect in basketball.

24665800	Relationship between general and specific coordination in 8- to 17-year-old male	"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationships between general coordination, sport-specific coordination, and sport-specific fitness of 8-
to 17-year-old male basketball players. 312 males with training experience ranging
from one year in the 8-year-old cohort up to 10 years for the 17-year-olds performed
basketball-specific fitness (20 m sprint, Illinois, countermovement jump), general
coordination (20 m run with three obstacles), semi-basketball-specific coordination
(20 m sprint dribbling two balls, countermovement jump with arm swing) and
basketball-specific coordination (Illinois ball dribbling) tests. There were
moderate to large correlations between the results of both general and
basketball-specific coordination with the results of most basketball-specific
coordination tests in all age groups. Correlations between general and
basketball-specific coordination were large in four age groups (11-14 yr., r = .52
to r = .76), moderate in five groups (8-10, 15 & 16 yr., r = .37 to r = .46), while
not significant in the 17-year-olds. These results suggest that the importance of
general coordination for sport-specific skills improvements during a sports-specific
skill acquisition phase, remains high at the skill refinement phase, and decreases
when sport-specific skills have been mastered to near-perfection.

32294618	A Systematic Review of the External and Internal Workloads Experienced During	"PURPOSE: To systematically quantify the external and internal workloads reported during games-based drills in basketball and identify the effects of different
modifiable factors on the workloads encountered. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE,
and SPORTDiscus databases were searched for original research published up until
January 2, 2019. The search included terms relevant to workload, games-based drills,
and basketball. Studies were screened using predefined selection criteria, and
methodological quality was assessed prior to data extraction. RESULTS: The
electronic search yielded 8,284 studies with 3,411 duplicates. A total of 17 studies
met the inclusion criteria for this review, with quality scores ranging from 9 to 10
out of 11. Factors regularly modified during games-based drills among the included
studies were team size, playing area, playing and rest time, and game alterations.
Games-based drills containing smaller team sizes elicited greater external and
internal workloads compared to larger team sizes. Furthermore, full-court
games-based drills elicited greater external and internal workloads compared to
half-court drills, while continuous games-based drills elicited greater internal
workloads compared to intermittent drills. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a
comprehensive collation of data indicating the external and internal workloads
reported during different games-based drills in various samples of basketball
players. Furthermore, evidence is provided for basketball coaches to consider when
prescribing games-based drills and modifying factors during drills across the
season. Current literature suggests that smaller team sizes and full-court playing
areas elicit greater external and internal workloads than larger team sizes and
half-court drills, respectively. Furthermore, continuous games-based drills elicit
greater internal workloads than intermittent drills.

26559380	The Influence of Unsportsmanlike Fouls on Basketball Teams' Performance According to	"The aim of the current study was to analyze the temporal effects that unsportsmanlike fouls may have on basketball teams' scoring performance under
consideration of context-related variables. The authors analyzed 130 unsportsmanlike
fouls from 362 elite basketball games (men's and women's Olympic Games, European and
World Championships). The context-related variables studied were score-line, quality
of opposition, timeout situation, minutes remaining, and player status. The data
were analyzed with linear-regression models. The results showed that both teams (the
team that made the foul and the opponent) had similar positive scoring performances
during 1 and 3 ball possessions after the unsportsmanlike foul (short-term effect).
However, 5 ball possessions after the foul (midterm effect), the team that made the
foul had a scoring disadvantage (-0.96) and the opponent team an advantage (0.78).
The context-related variable quality of opposition was significant only during 1
ball possession, with negative effects for the team that made the foul and positive
effects for the opponent. The final outcome showed a positive effect for score-line
when the unsportsmanlike foul was made (0.96) and for quality of opposition (0.64).

28644113	The importance and development of ball control and (self-reported) self-regulatory	"This study first investigated the importance of ball control and (self-reported) self-regulatory skills in achieving the elite level in basketball. The second aim
was to gain insight into the development of, and association between ball control
and (self-reported) self-regulatory skills that contribute to achieving the elite
level, with taking into account positional differences. Talented male players
(N = 73; age 16.56 ± 1.96) completed the STARtest to measure ball control and a
questionnaire to measure (self-reported) self-regulation from 2008-2012. Results
showed that (self-reported) reflective skills were most important to achieve the
elite level (OR = 11.76; P < 0.05). There was no significant improvement in
(self-reported) reflection over time for guards, forwards, and centers. Improvement
in ball control was evident for guards (r = -0.65; P < 0.05). Furthermore, guards
and forwards had better ball control compared to centers (P < 0.01). For those two
positions, negative correlations were found between (self-reported) reflection and
ball control, i.e., higher reflection was related to better ball control (guards
r = -0.19; forwards r = -0.18) in contrast to centers (r = 0.34). It is concluded
that (self-reported) reflective skills are important to achieve the elite level,
while ball control seems especially important for guards.

retrospectively compare injury rates in women's and men's professional basketball.
HYPOTHESIS: Female professional basketball players are injured at a higher rate than
are men. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (prevalence); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS:
Women's National Basketball Association and National Basketball Association injury
data were retrospectively reviewed for 6 full seasons. The frequency of all injuries
and the rate of game-related injuries were calculated. RESULTS: Complete player
profiles were obtained on 702 National Basketball Association athletes and 443
Women's National Basketball Association athletes who competed in their respective
leagues during the data collection period. Total game exposures totaled 70,420
(National Basketball Association) and 22,980 (Women's National Basketball
Association). Women's National Basketball Association athletes had a higher overall
game-related injury rate (24.9 per 1000 athlete exposures; 95% confidence interval,
22.9-26.9; P < .05) when compared with National Basketball Association athletes
(19.3 per 1000 athlete exposures; 95% confidence interval, 18.3-20.4) and sustained
a higher rate of lower extremity injuries (14.6 per 1000 athlete exposures; 95%
confidence interval, 13.1-16.2; P < .05) than seen in the National Basketball
Association (11.6 per 1000 athlete exposures; 95% confidence interval, 10.8-12.4).
The lower extremity was the most commonly injured body area (65%), and lateral ankle
sprain (13.7%) was the most common diagnosis in both leagues. The incidence of
game-related knee injury was higher in Women's National Basketball Association
players. The incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injury in the National
Basketball Association (n = 22, 0.8%) and Women's National Basketball Association (n
= 14, 0.9%) accounted for 0.8% of the 4446 injuries reported. CONCLUSION: The lower
extremity is the most frequently injured body area in both leagues, and Women's
National Basketball Association athletes are more susceptible than are National
Basketball Association athletes. There were, however, few statistical differences in
the actual injuries occurring between the 2 leagues.

27647363	Towards a Decision Quality Model for Shot Selection in Basketball: an Exploratory	"We take the first steps towards a shot selection quality model in basketball that incorporates decisional cues that might be predictive, not only of proximal results
(e.g., scoring), but also of distal results (e.g., winning/losing the match). 2976
jump-shots from 50 Euroleague matches were sampled, following systematic observation
guidelines. The decisional cues under scrutiny were shooting opposition, distance
and lateral angle, disposition to offensive rebound and disposition to defensive
balance at the moment of shooting. A first set of regressions between decisional
cues and proximal results showed higher opposition and distance to decrease the
probability of scoring (OR = .81; p < .001 and OR = .89; p = .013); a better
disposition towards rebound to increase the chances of catching rebound (OR = 1.57;
p < .001); and better defensive balance disposition to decrease the probability of a
fast break (OR = 1.27; p < .036). A second set of regressions between proximal and
distal results showed shooting and offensive rebound effectiveness to predict total
points scored (β = .62; p < .001 and β = .32; p < .001) and game result
(winning/losing the game; OR = 1.12; p < .001 and OR = 1.05; p = .021). Finally, an
analysis of the impact of decisional cues on distal results showed a positive
relationship between likelihood of winning and average team's disposition to
offensive rebound (OR = 1.18; p = .018). These results cast light on the actual
weights (validities) of the different cues involved in predicting outcomes of
shooting decisions. This evidence could help coaches provide objective feedback
about players' shooting performance beyond hit percentages.

25775217	On the Role of Proprioception in Making Free Throws in Basketball.	"PURPOSE: The aim of this article was to investigate the role that proprioception of the upper limb plays in making basketball free throws. METHOD: We designed an
experiment to directly correlate the performance of basketball players in a
free-throw task and an elbow- and wrist-joint position sense task. RESULTS: We found
a moderately high correlation between the free-throw success rate and wrist-joint
position sense and a moderate correlation between the free-throw success rate and
elbow-joint position sense. In both cases, the most successful shooters also had the
best proprioceptive results. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that free-throw
success is, at least partly, determined by players' ability to sense the position of
the distal joints of their throwing upper limb. From a motor-control point of view,
this suggests that basketball players may organize the compensatory behavior between
the joints of their free-throwing arm on the basis of proprioception. From a
practical point of view, it points toward new training techniques to enhance
free-throwing efficiency.

27140952	The Commonality Between Approaches to Determine Jump Fatigue During Basketball	"PURPOSE: Declines in high-intensity activity during game play (in-game approach) and performance tests measured pre- and postgame (across-game approach) have been used
to assess player fatigue in basketball. However, a direct comparison of these
approaches is not available. Consequently, this study examined the commonality
between in- and across-game jump fatigue during simulated basketball game play.
METHODS: Australian, state-level, junior male basketball players (n = 10; 16.6 ± 1.1
y, 182.4 ± 4.3 cm, 68.3 ± 10.2 kg) completed 4 × 10-min standardized quarters of
simulated basketball game play. In-game jump height during game play was measured
using video analysis, while across-game jump height was determined pre-, mid-, and
postgame play using an in-ground force platform. Jump height was determined using
the flight-time method, with jump decrement calculated for each approach across the
first half, second half, and entire game. RESULTS: A greater jump decrement was
apparent for the in-game approach than for the across-game approach in the first
half (37.1% ± 11.6% vs 1.7% ± 6.2%; P = .005; d = 3.81, large), while
nonsignificant, large differences were evident between approaches in the second half
(d = 1.14) and entire game (d = 1.83). Nonsignificant associations were evident
between in-game and across-game jump decrement, with shared variances of 3-26%.
CONCLUSIONS: Large differences and a low commonality were observed between in- and
across-game jump fatigue during basketball game play, suggesting that these
approaches measure different constructs. Based on our findings, it is not
recommended that basketball coaches use these approaches interchangeably to monitor
player fatigue across the season.

30216874	Does the single-limb stance reflect chronic ankle instability in an athlete?	"BACKGROUND: The single-limb stance with closed eyes has been widely used to evaluate chronic ankle instability as static balance; however, there was lack of
consideration of whether difference in age, frequency of previous ankle sprain or
physical ability influenced single-limb stance. RESEARCH QUESTION: We hypothesized
that the single-limb stance might not reflect subjective ankle instability and
function on physical activity in people who perform sports activities. METHODS: In
total, 102 high school basketball players were recruited to evaluate their physical
performance at the beginning of the season. Participants were divided into five
groups based on the frequency of previous ankle sprain. Karlsson ankle function
score (K score) was considered as a subjective ankle function score, that was
divided into various components. Each component and the single-limb stance test with
center of pressure (COP) analysis was observed between the frequency of ankle
sprains with one-way ANOVA and compared using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient to verify the relationship between the K score and COP. RESULTS: For COP
parameters, no difference was observed in the history of ankle sprains. The K score
was lower in participants with three previous ankle sprains than in those with a
different number of ankle sprains for instability, stiffness, running, work
activities, support, and total K score for all parameters. There were weak negative
correlations (r = -0.19∼-0.35) between K score and COP parameters among participants
with no history of ankle sprain or only once. In contrast, there were strong
positive correlations (r = 0.69∼0.87) among history of ankle sprain at third.
SIGNIFICANCE: The single-limb stance might not accurately reflect an athlete's ankle
instability and function on physical activity. Clinically, therapists should choose
suitable evaluation tools depending on the athlete's activity level to check for
chronic ankle instability.

-based ML and rating-of-perceived-exertion (RPE) -based ML methods. METHODS:
HR-based measurements of ML included Edwards ML and Stagno training impulses
(TRIMPMOD), while RPE-based ML measurements included respiratory (sRPEres) and
muscular (sRPEmus). Data were collected from 10 WB players during a whole
competitive season. RESULTS: Edwards ML and TRIMPMOD averaged across 16 matches were
255.3 ± 66.3 and 167.9 ± 67.1 AU, respectively. In contrast, sRPEres ML and sRPEmus
ML were found to be higher (521.9 ± 188.7 and 536.9 ± 185.8 AU, respectively).
Moderate correlations (r = .629-.648, P < .001) between Edwards ML and RPE-based ML
methods were found. Moreover, similar significant correlations were also shown
between the TRIMPMOD and RPE-based ML methods (r = .627-.668, P < .001). That said,
only ≥40% of variance in HR-based ML was explained by RPE-based ML, which could be
explained by the heterogeneity of physical-impairment type. CONCLUSION: RPE-based ML
methods could be used as an indicator of global internal ML in highly trained WB
players.

26171606	Exploring Game Performance in the National Basketball Association Using Player	"Recent player tracking technology provides new information about basketball game performance. The aim of this study was to (i) compare the game performances of
all-star and non all-star basketball players from the National Basketball
Association (NBA), and (ii) describe the different basketball game performance
profiles based on the different game roles. Archival data were obtained from all
2013-2014 regular season games (n = 1230). The variables analyzed included the
points per game, minutes played and the game actions recorded by the player tracking
system. To accomplish the first aim, the performance per minute of play was analyzed
using a descriptive discriminant analysis to identify which variables best predict
the all-star and non all-star playing categories. The all-star players showed slower
velocities in defense and performed better in elbow touches, defensive rebounds,
close touches, close points and pull-up points, possibly due to optimized attention
processes that are key for perceiving the required appropriate environmental
information. The second aim was addressed using a k-means cluster analysis, with the
aim of creating maximal different performance profile groupings. Afterwards, a
descriptive discriminant analysis identified which variables best predict the
different playing clusters. The results identified different playing profile of
performers, particularly related to the game roles of scoring, passing, defensive
and all-round game behavior. Coaching staffs may apply this information to different
players, while accounting for individual differences and functional variability, to
optimize practice planning and, consequently, the game performances of individuals
and teams.

26967064	Sex differences in cardiovascular demands of refereeing during international	"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of sex on cardiovascular responses of referees during elite international basketball
competition. METHODS: Twenty-seven elite referees (9 female; 18 male) officiated a
random sample of 18 matches during the final round of the 2013 Women's Eurobasket
Championship. Continuous recordings of referees' heart rate (HR) during matches were
obtained and analyzed for average HR, relative exercise intensity (% maximum HR,
HRmax) and proportion of time spent within different exercise-intensity categories.
RESULTS: During the championship, the average match HR was >150 bpm and approximated
an exercise intensity of >85% HRmax for referees. Female referees exhibited lower
average match HR (156.8 ± 10.2 vs. 163.6 ± 11.6 bpm, p<0.05) and exercise intensity
(86.2 ± 5.5 vs. 89.5 ± 6.0% HRmax, p<0.05) compared to male referees. Referees spent
most (>70%) of each match at a HR intensity of 70-89% HRmax with females
experiencing more match time within the 55-69% HRmax category compared to males.
Average HR and exercise intensity was greatest for all referees during the early
part of the match (Quarter 1) that declined over the match. CONCLUSION: This study
has demonstrated that sex significantly influences cardiovascular responses for
elite basketball referees with lower responses for females potentially reflective of
different movement patterns. Reductions in cardiovascular response noted during
matches for all referees may reflect alterations in metabolism, match activities or
induction of fatigue that should be considered in the development and training of
elite referees for optimal match performance.

24533498	The influence of in-game emotions on basketball performance.	"This study examined the influence of emotions on performance in basketball. Six female basketball players were videotaped in six games. Frequency of performance
behaviours was recorded minute-by-minute and indices of successful (SGI) and
unsuccessful (UGI) game involvement derived for each player. Post-game, players
reported the intensity of experienced emotions (anger, anxiety, embarrassment,
excitement and happiness), and the time of the eliciting incident. The only emotion
revealed as a significant predictor of SGI was happiness; both anger and
embarrassment were significant predictors of increased UGI. Consideration of
individual player analyses suggests that there is variation in the magnitude of the
influence of emotions on performance and the extent to which this influence was
helpful or harmful to performance. The study provides evidence that emotions are
associated with changes in game behaviours in competition. Implications for further
research examining the emotion-performance relationship are discussed.

25946305	Increased Athletic Performance in Lighter Basketball Shoes: Shoe or Psychology	"PURPOSE: To determine the effect of shoe mass on performance in basketball-specific movements and how this affects changes if an athlete is aware or not of the shoe's
mass relative to other shoes. METHODS: In an experimental design, 22 male
participants were assigned to 2 groups. In the ""aware"" group, differences in the
mass of the shoes were disclosed, while participants in the other group were blinded
to the mass of shoes. For both groups lateral shuffle-cut and vertical-jump
performances were quantified in 3 different basketball-shoe conditions (light, 352 ±
18.4 g; medium, 510 ± 17 g; heavy, 637 ± 17.7 g). A mixed ANOVA compared mean
shuffle-cut and vertical-jump performances across shoes and groups. For blinded
participants, perceived shoe-weight ratings were collected and compared across shoe
conditions using a Friedman 2-way ANOVA. RESULTS: In the aware group, performance in
the light shoes was significantly increased by 2% (vertical jump 2%, P < .001;
shuffle cut 2.1%, P < .001) compared with the heavy shoes. In the blind group,
participants were unable to perceive the shoe-weight variation between conditions,
and there were no significant differences in vertical-jump and shuffle-cut
performance across shoes. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in performance of the aware
participants were most likely due to psychological effects such as positive and
negative expectancies toward the light and heavy shoes, respectively. These results
underline the importance for coaches and shoe manufacturers to communicate the
performance-enhancing benefits of products or other interventions to athletes to
optimize their performance outcome.

28361655	The Effect of Variability of Practice at Execution Redundancy Level in Skilled and	"We investigated the effect of practice variability through execution redundancy in skilled and novice basketball players on free throw skills. Twelve skilled
basketball players and 12 novices (mean age = 25.4 years, SD = 4.3) were divided
into four groups (skilled constant, skilled variable, novice constant, and novice
variable). After a pretest, participants practiced free throw action. The variable
groups threw the ball over an obstacle of varying heights on each trial in random
order, whereas the obstacle's height was fixed for the constant groups. After 7 and
14 consecutive days of practice, participants performed two posttests with constant
and variable distances from the basket. The results showed that practicing different
solutions of a task did not affect the performance of skilled players but had an
immediate negative effect on the performance of novice players. Learning a complex
task is the result of learning task-related parameters, and practice variability can
create a mismatch between task difficulty and new learner skill levels.

25380477	Perceived Sources of Team Confidence in Soccer and Basketball.	"PURPOSE: Although it is generally accepted that team confidence is beneficial for optimal team functioning and performance, little is known about the predictors of
team confidence. The present study was aimed to shed light on the precursors of both
high and low team confidence in two different sports. A distinction is made between
sources of process-oriented team confidence (i.e., collective efficacy) and sources
of outcome-oriented team confidence (i.e., team outcome confidence), which have
often been confounded in previous research. METHODS: In a first step, two
qualitative studies were conducted to identify all possible sources of team
confidence in basketball and in soccer. In a second step, three quantitative studies
were conducted to further investigate the sources of team outcome confidence in
soccer (N = 1028) and in basketball (N = 867), and the sources of collective
efficacy in basketball (N = 825). RESULTS: Players perceived high-quality
performance as the most important factor for their team outcome confidence. With
regard to collective efficacy, team enthusiasm was perceived as most predictive
determinant. Positive coaching emerged as second most decisive factor for both types
of team confidence. In contrast, negative communication and expression by the
players or the coach was perceived as the most decisive predictor of low levels of
team confidence. At item level, all studies pointed to the importance of team
confidence expression by the athlete leaders (i.e., leader figures within the team)
and the coach. CONCLUSION: The present manuscript sheds light on the precursors of
high and low levels of team confidence. Athlete leaders and the coach emerged as key
triggers of both upward and downward spirals of team confidence, thereby
contaminating all team members.

27874302	Sprint Performance of Elite Wheelchair Basketball Players: Applicability of a Laser	"The purpose of this study was to develop a methodology to accurately analyze sprint performance of elite wheelchair basketball (WB) players in their own training
context using a laser system and to analyze the velocity curve performed by the
players regarding their functional classification and their playing position. Twelve
WB players, from the Spanish men's national team, took part in an oncourt
20-m-sprint test. BioLaserSport® was used to obtain time, mean velocities (Vm),
maximum velocities (Vmax), and distances at 90%, 95%, and 98% of their Vmax. Vm and
Vmax reached high values in Classes II and III and in the guard playing position.
The protocol developed with the laser system makes it possible to obtain a precise
velocity curve in short sprints and allows easy analysis of decisive kinematic
performance variables in WB players, showing immediate feedback to coaches and
players. The normalized data allow an interpretation of how much, where, and when
Vmax occurs along the test.

measuring jump load compared to traditional counting methods. The purpose of this
study was to validate a commercially available jump counter (VERT® Classic) in youth

direction, takeoff) of jumps recorded by the VERT® Classic. 46 (19F, 27M) youth
basketball players wore a VERT® Classic and were recorded on video during games and
practices. The number of jumps recorded by the VERT® Classic and evaluated by video
raters were compared for each jump characteristic using intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC(3,k)), mean offset, and limits of agreement. The number and percent
of VERT® Classic jumps and corresponding video jumps according to timestamp were
reported. VERT® Classic jumps had excellent reliability with video-counted jumps
over 15 cm (ICC(3,k) = 0.958), with a mean offset of -2.4 jumps (fewer VERT®
Classic) and limits of agreement -12.6 to 7.8 jumps. Pairs of corresponding jumps
represented 68.0% of total video jumps and 92.0% of VERT® Classic jumps. The VERT®

automatic beliefs about sport ability in these two sports. The IAT scores evidence
that swimmers and basketball players automatically and implicitly associate their

23237782	Heart-rate responses by playing position during ball drills in basketball.	"The physiological load experienced during basketball drills is crucial to understand players' adaptation to team-sport training and plan physical-conditioning programs.
PURPOSE: To compare mean heart-rate (HRmean) responses by playing position during
2-a-side (2v2) and 3-a-side (3v3) ball drills in male junior basketball players and
explore the relationship between HRmean and repeated-sprint ability (RSA). METHODS:
Thirty- one players volunteered to participate in this study. On separate occasions,
they performed 2v2 and 3v3 ball drills and 6 repetitions of shuttle-run sprints of
20 m (10+10 m), departing every 20 s (RSA). Ball drills took place on the full
length but only half the width of the court and were three 4-min bouts separated by
1-min rest periods. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) assessed the effect of the
number of players on court (2v2 vs 3v3) and playing position (guards vs forwards vs
centers) on HRmean, and a Pearson correlation coefficient evaluated the relation
between HRmean and RSA. RESULTS: The main results showed greater HRmean in 2v2 than
in 3v3 ball drills (P < .001) in all playing positions (90.7% ± 1.3% vs 87.6% ± 3%
of HRpeak in guards, 91.3% ± 2.1% vs 87.5% ± 3.7% of HRpeak for forwards, and 88.2%
± 3.5% vs 82.2% ± 5.6% of HRpeak in centers, respectively, for 2v2 and 3v3). In
addition, centers were characterized by lower HRmean than guards and forwards in 3v3
only (P = .018). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 2v2 drills should be
preferred to 3v3 drills for aerobic conditioning, in particular for centers.
Finally, RSA does not seem to influence players' acute responses to ball drills.

a lack of information about the physical characteristics and performance of the
referees. The aim of this study was to characterize the neuromuscular and metabolic
performances and body composition of Brazilian elite basketball referees, with a
level of national and international refereeing. METHODS: Thirty-seven referees
participated in the study (international level N.=17 and national level N.=20). We
evaluated anthropometric and body composition variables, among them: height, body
mass, body mass index (BMI) and body fat (%); metabolic parameters: lactate at rest
and post-exercise; and neuromuscular performance: speed, explosive lower limbs
strength, flexibility and aerobic capacity. The main results showed a statistically
significant difference in age, in which the international referees were older than
the national level (41.94±6.71; 37.30±7.23; P=0.036). RESULTS: There were not
significant differences between the levels for neuromuscular and metabolic
parameters and body composition. Comparing the results with athletes, the referees
showed lower neuromuscular and metabolic parameters and the body composition showed
higher body fat than basketball players. CONCLUSION: These data may represent
physiological parameters to be considered in the prescription of physical training
during the preparation and competition period.

24853373	Spatial generalization in operant learning: lessons from professional basketball.	"In operant learning, behaviors are reinforced or inhibited in response to the consequences of similar actions taken in the past. However, because in natural
environments the ""same"" situation never recurs, it is essential for the learner to
decide what ""similar"" is so that he can generalize from experience in one state of
the world to future actions in different states of the world. The computational
principles underlying this generalization are poorly understood, in particular
because natural environments are typically too complex to study quantitatively. In
this paper we study the principles underlying generalization in operant learning of
professional basketball players. In particular, we utilize detailed information
about the spatial organization of shot locations to study how players adapt their
attacking strategy in real time according to recent events in the game. To quantify
this learning, we study how a make\miss from one location in the court affects the
probabilities of shooting from different locations. We show that generalization is
not a spatially-local process, nor is governed by the difficulty of the shot.
Rather, to a first approximation, players use a simplified binary representation of
the court into 2 pt and 3 pt zones. This result indicates that rather than using
low-level features, generalization is determined by high-level cognitive processes
that incorporate the abstract rules of the game.

24397711	Anticipation by basketball defenders: an explanation based on the three-dimensional	"We previously estimated the timing when ball game defenders detect relevant information through visual input for reacting to an attacker's running direction
after a cutting manoeuvre, called cue timing. The purpose of this study was to
investigate what specific information is relevant for defenders, and how defenders
process this information to decide on their opponents' running direction. In this
study, we hypothesised that defenders extract information regarding the position and
velocity of the attackers' centre of mass (CoM) and the contact foot. We used a
model which simulates the future trajectory of the opponent's CoM based upon an
inverted pendulum movement. The hypothesis was tested by comparing observed
defender's cue timing, model-estimated cue timing using the inverted pendulum model
(IPM cue timing) and cue timing using only the current CoM position (CoM cue
timing). The IPM cue timing was defined as the time when the simulated pendulum
falls leftward or rightward given the initial values for position and velocity of
the CoM and the contact foot at the time. The model-estimated IPM cue timing and the
empirically observed defender's cue timing were comparable in median value and were
significantly correlated, whereas the CoM cue timing was significantly more delayed
than the IPM and the defender's cue timings. Based on these results, we discuss the
possibility that defenders may be able to anticipate the future direction of an
attacker by forwardly simulating inverted pendulum movement.

design, 30 recreational, male basketball athletes were randomly allocated to either
a control (CON, n = 15, loose-fitting clothing) or experimental group (COMP, n = 15,
compression garments) for 15 h following fatigue-inducing, basketball-specific
exercise in the evening (1600-1800 h). Perceptual measures of fatigue and muscle
soreness, as well as physical performance tests (sprints, jumps and agility), were
performed pre-exercise, post-exercise, and post-recovery (15 h following exercise).
Subjective and objective measures of sleep were recorded following the exercise
trial. There were non-significant (p > 0.05), unclear-trivial differences between
groups for all performance measures. Perceived post-recovery fatigue (d = -1.27,
large) and muscle soreness (d = -1.61, large) were significantly lower in COMP
compared to CON (p < 0.05). COMP exhibited better perceived sleep quality (d = 0.42,
small, p = 0.18) than CON, with an unclear difference in sleep duration between
groups (p > 0.05). Wearing lower-body compression garments overnight improved
perceived fatigue and muscle soreness, but had negligible effects on subsequent
physical performance in basketball athletes. Future research should focus on longer
periods of compression wear following fatiguing exercise.

determine the somatotype of high profile Lithuanian athletes in kayaking, basketball
and football and to compare between disciplines and with low level sportsmen of the
same age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 72 young male sportsmen aged from 18 to
24 years were divided into three groups (kayakers, basketball and football players).
Each group contained almost equal numbers of low level and elite, international
level sportsmen. Anthropometric measurements of the players were used to establish
somatotypes. RESULTS: The greatest difference was observed in the mesomorphic
component of elite kayakers compared to the low profile sportsmen. Mesomorphy could
also be used to predict sport ability. The range of mesomorphy for elite footballers
was from 0 to 4.6, for basketball players from 4.6 to 5.9, and for kayaking, from
5.9 and higher. Individual groups of elite sportsmen displayed different modes of
somatotype. The kayakers were predominantly endomorphic; the basketball players
mostly endomorphic and the footballers most often ectomorphic. No distinguishable
patterns of somatotype were displayed by the low level sportsmen. CONCLUSIONS:
Morphometric characteristics of the athlete's body and the fractional somatotype can
be used as guiders and markers of the chosen sport and method of training. The
results emphasize the necessity for a specific somatotype to reach a high profile in
the selected area of sport and thus support morphometric oriented studies. Further
studies could elucidate differentiation by age and sex.

28568314	Greater circadian disadvantage during evening games for the National Basketball	"We investigated the effects of a circadian disadvantage (i.e. playing in a different time zone) on the winning percentages in three major sport leagues in North America:
the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League and the National
Football League. We reviewed 5 years of regular season games in the National
Basketball Association, National Hockey League and National Football League, and
noted the winning percentage of the visiting team depending on the direction of
travel (west, east, and same time zone) and game time (day and evening games).
T-tests and analysis of variance were performed to evaluate the effects of the
circadian disadvantage, its direction, the number of time zones travelled, and the
game time on winning percentages in each major league. The results showed an
association between the winning percentages and the number of time zones traveled
for the away evening games, with a clear disadvantage for the teams travelling
westward. There was a significant difference in the teams' winning percentages
depending on the travelling direction in the National Basketball Association

P = 0.011), and a trend was found in the National Football League (F(2,1279)
= 2.86, P = 0.058). The effect of the circadian disadvantage transcends the type of
sport and needs to be addressed for greater equity among the western and eastern
teams in professional sports. These results also highlight the importance of

basketball players were randomly allocated to intermittent training (IT=8) or
repeated sprint ability training (RST=8) groups. The following outcomes were
measured at baseline and after 6 weeks of training: Yo-Yo intermittent recovery
(Yo-Yo) and repeated sprint ability (RSA) tests. RESULTS: For all the variables
investigated the effect of training type showed a different trend respect at current
knowledge. In the RSA, best time (BT) was a significant main effect of training time
(pre- vs. post-) (P<0.0001), and of the interaction training type/time (P=0.03). The
RST showed a decrease in BT of 3.1% (P=0.005) while the IT showed a decrease of 6.2%
(P<0.0001). In the IT there was a significant main effect of time for the total
distance with an increment of 26.9%, and a significant main effect of time in the
final speed with an increment of 1.23%. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the
two training methods used in this study can be an effective training strategy for
inducing anaerobic and basketball-specific training schedules. Besides, even when IT
training is not done at very high speed, it can increase the maximum speed of the
RSA.

25427817	The effect of perceived streakiness on the shot-taking behaviour of basketball	"We examine behavioural changes of basketball players arising from the hot-hand belief and use data of 1216 National Basketball Association games to measure the
effect of cold and hot streaks on three proxies of shot difficulty. We find that the
more consecutive shots players make (miss), the more difficult (easier) shots become
along the three dimensions. Furthermore, most players' performance seems to improve
during hot streaks because they attempt more difficult shots while no significant
decrease in shooting accuracy takes place. This might explain why most previous
studies could not find empirical evidence for the hot-hand belief in basketball when
considering in-game field goal shooting.

26659134	Modeling the Offensive-Defensive Interaction and Resulting Outcomes in Basketball.	"PURPOSE: We analyzed the interaction between offensive (i.e. space creation dynamics--SCDs) and defensive (i.e. space protection dynamics--SPDs) actions in six
play outcomes (free shot, contested shot, new SCD, reset, foul, and turnover) in
Spanish professional basketball games. METHOD: Data consisted of 1548
SCD-SPD-outcome triples obtained from six play-off games. We used Bayesian methods
to compute marginal probabilities of six outcomes following five different SCDs. We
also computed probabilities of the six outcomes following the 16 most frequent
SCD-SPD combinations. RESULTS: The pick action (e.g. pick and roll, pop and pop) was
the most prevalent SCD (33%). However, this SCD did not produce the highest
probability of a free shot (0.235). The highest probability of a free shot followed
the SCD without ball (0.409). The pick was performed not only to attempt scoring but
also to initiate offenses, as it produced the highest probability leading to a new
SCD (0.403). Additionally, the SPD performed influenced the outcome of the SCD. This
reinforces the notion that the opposition (offensive-defensive interaction) should
be considered. To the best of our knowledge, in team sports, this is the first study
to successfully model the tactical features involved in offense-defense
interactions. Our analyses revealed that the high frequency of occurrence of some
SCDs may be justified not only by an associated high probability of free shots but
also by the possibility of progressively create more space in the defense (i.e. a
new SCD as outcome). In the second case, it evidences offensive strategic features
of progressive disruption of the defensive system through the concatenation of

27681710	Do previous sports experiences influence the effect of an enrichment programme in	"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of an enrichment programme in motor, technical and tactical basketball skills, when accounting for the age of youth sport
specialisation. Seventy-six college students (age: M = 20.4, SD = 1.9) were
allocated according to three different paths: (i) non-structured (n = 14), (ii)
early specialisation (n = 34), and (iii) late specialisation (n = 28), according to
information previously provided by the participants about the quantity and type of
sporting activities performed throughout their sporting careers. Then, the
participants of each path were randomly distributed across control and experimental
groups. Variables under study included agility, technical skills circuit, as well as
tactical actions performed in a 4-on-4 full-court basketball game. The results
indicated improvements in the early and late specialisation paths namely in the
experimental training groups. However, the late specialisation path revealed larger
benefits, in contrast with the non-structured path, which showed less sensitivity to
the enrichment programme, mostly sustained in physical literacy and differential
learning. Higher improvements were observed in agility, and also in reducing the
number of unsuccessful actions performed during the game. Overall, this study
provided evidence of how early sports experiences affect basketball skill
acquisition and contribute to adapt to new contexts with motor and
technical-tactical challenges. In addition, a path supported by late specialisation
might present several advantages in sport performance achievement.

26898057	Performance Indicators of the Top Basketball Players: Relations with Several	"The aim of this study was to determine the differences in performance indicators for top senior male basketball players, with respect to several independent variables:
position in the team, total situation-related efficiency, age, playing experience
and the time spent on the court within the game and during championship season. The
final sample of participants was selected from all teams in A-1 Croatian men's
basketball league. Significant differences have been found according to the
players': position in the team, total situation-related efficiency, and in
interactions of the position in the team / total situation-related efficiency and
minutes spent on the court in a game / playing experience. The differences in the
situation-related efficiency between players have not been found according to the
players' age and the number of games played. Further research can be directed
towards deeper analysis of the influence of more complex differentiated variables
playing experience and time spent on the court in a game on situation-related
efficiency in basketball.

17714989	Physiological demands of basketball refereeing during international competition.	"To date, the physiological effects of elite competition on basketball players have been reported while very little information exists concerning the effects of elite
competition on referees. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the
physiological demands of basketball refereeing during international competition.
Seven elite basketball referees volunteered for this study during a pre-Olympic
women's basketball tournament. During each of the eight tournament matches, heart
rate (HR), relative exercise intensity as a percentage of age-predicted maximum HR
(HR(max)), proportion of match time within the ACSM-defined exercise intensity
categories were recorded for each referee during each quarter of and the entire
match. Comparisons between quarters for each variable were conducted using one-way
ANOVAs. There were no significant differences between quarters for any variable.
Referees, using a two-referee per match format, worked at an average HR of 150bpm
(range 110-181bpm) for each quarter of the match, equating to a relative intensity
of >70% HR(max) for the majority ( approximately 76%) of each quarter. Basketball
refereeing during international competition results in significant physiological
exertion at relatively high exercise intensities for Australian referees. Further
studies will assist in the development of appropriate training programs for elite
basketball referees to maintain and/or maximise performance.

24368829	Postural characterization of adolescent federation basketball players.	"BACKGROUND: The adolescent players federated to basketball have a high-level of endurance demand, often overloading the biological tissues and causing biomechanical
compensations. Due to the immaturity of their musculoskeletal structures those
consequences may influence the growing process and lead to the development of
various postural patterns. We aimed to evaluate the postural alignment of the trunk
in players. METHODS: Participants, 74 healthy adolescents: 36 basketball players
(BG) and 38 adolescents in control group (CG). First, adolescents were marked with
spheres over specific anatomical landmarks. Postural photographs were taken in the
sagittal and frontal planes, and analyzed using the free internet Postural Analysis
Software to obtain quantitative measures of the head, shoulders, and trunk. RESULTS:
ANCOVA has revealed significant group effects: players demonstrated greater lateral
spinal inclination (P < .008). In the right sagittal plane, the BG had lower angular
values of forward head position (P < .02), pelvic ante version (P < .02), vertical
alignment of the trunk (P < .02), and thoracic kyphosis (P < .005). The covariate
analysis has indicated that age influences the alignments of both the shoulders and
the left scapula; and height influences the scapular alignment. CONCLUSIONS: This
study has demonstrated that basketball training within federations influences the
musculoskeletal system of adolescents and reflects a process of postural
adaptations.

19251677	Results and performance after microfracture in National Basketball Association	"BACKGROUND: Microfracture technique is commonly used to treat symptomatic chondral lesions of the knee. Performance outcomes and attrition rates associated with this
injury/surgery in National Basketball Association athletes are unclear. HYPOTHESIS:
National Basketball Association players undergoing microfracture for symptomatic
chondral lesions of the knee will have demonstrable differences in performance
compared with preinjury and with matched controls. STUDY DESIGN: Case control study;
Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: We evaluated 24 National Basketball Association
players who underwent microfracture between 1997 and 2006. Descriptive data and
performance data for the first full season preceding and following the index surgery
were collected. Data were obtained from 48 matched controls. Univariate/multivariate
statistical methods were used to assess change in performance and return to play.
RESULTS: Thirty-three percent (8 of 24) of National Basketball Association athletes
who underwent microfracture surgery never returned to play in the National
Basketball Association. Fourteen players returned to play in the National Basketball
Association for >1 season. Within-group comparisons revealed that points scored (P =
.008) and minutes played (P = .045) were reduced postoperatively. No performance
variables were significantly different when averaged over 40 minutes of play. When
compared with controls, cases experienced a significant decline in points per game
(P = .013). Multiple regression analysis revealed that cases were 8.15 times less
likely to remain in the National Basketball Association than controls (P = .005)
after the index year. CONCLUSION: Players undergoing microfracture for knee chondral
injuries are at risk for not returning to the National Basketball Association
postoperatively. With the exception of points per game, athletes returning exhibited
similar performance postoperatively compared with matched controls.

19826289	Using basketball test battery to monitor players with mental retardation across 2	"Although sport for athletes with mental retardation (MR) is achieving an important role, literature concerning basketball test and training is still poor. The aims of
this study were to assess basketball ability before (PRE) and after (POST) a 6-month
training in athletes with MR across 2 sports seasons (ss) and to analyze the
variation of basketball abilities by subjects' MR level. Fifteen trained basketball
players with MR participated (11 men and 4 women; age range 19-43 years; MR: 3 Mild,
8 Moderate, 3 Severe, and 1 Profound). Athletes were tested PRE and POST a 6-month
training during 2 following sports seasons (ss1 and ss2). The tests assessed 4
ability levels, each one characterized by the analysis of 4 fundamental areas (ball
handling, reception, passing, and shooting), divided into 5 specific components. The
athletes' global score improved after training in both ss1 (41.5 +/- 12.0 vs. 48.6
+/- 15.4; p < 0.01) and ss2 (41.7 +/- 12.4 vs. 50.8 +/- 16.2; p < 0.01). Levels II,
III, and IV showed an increase both after each ss and the 2 following ss (p < 0.01).
No significant difference was found between POST-ss1 and POST-ss2 due to score
decrease during the resting period between the 2 ss. In both ss, global and level
scores were negatively correlated to MR level indicating that athletes with a lower
MR obtained higher ability scores. In conclusion, a 6-month training caused a
general improvement, especially evident in levels II and III in both ss. Global and
level scores were negatively correlated to MR level (p < 0.05) indicating that
athletes with a lower MR obtained higher scores. Therefore, the basketball test
battery could be useful for improving and monitoring training.

prominent predominantly White institution in the Deep South as well as the later
insights and experiences of his sons at the same university; and (b) to present a
counterstory to the dominant historical rendering of the Civil Rights Movement, the
integration of athletics, and the experiences and outcomes of contemporary African
American athletes. METHOD: Using qualitative critical race methodology,
investigators conducted and analyzed interviews with the 1st African American to
play basketball at a prominent university located in the Deep South and his 2 sons
who attended the same university a generation later. RESULTS: Using the lens of
critical race theory, the themes conceived from the analysis were the counterstory
of agency, counterstorytelling stereotypes, and the salience of everyday racism.
CONCLUSION: Racism is still existent within society, even within college athletics.
The holistic success of African American athletes in college is dependent upon their
ability to navigate overt and covert racial climates.

9417650	[Wheelchair basketball from the orthopedic viewpoint].	"155 (aged 16 to 52 years) wheelchair basketball players were surveyed to determine athletic injuries and overload-syndromes. During their active participation in
wheelchair basketball 60.6% of the players have suffered 272 injuries and
overload-syndromes. Those were mainly localised at the upper extremity (74.6%).
Acute injuries predominate with 57.7%. Strains of the finger joint and skin injuries
were found to be the most common injuries. Myogelosis and tendinosis were the most
common reported overload-syndromes. A significantly higher number of complaints were
associated with wheelchair basketball participation at league-level and depending on
the player's position. At the end of the article the means of possible additional
disability and consequences to specify therapy and prevention for disabled will be
discussed.

12911477	Echocardiographic evaluation of wheelchair-bound basketball players.	"BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary function in sedentary men whose lower limbs have been immobilized for years has been shown to be markedly lower than normal. However, the
cardiopulmonary function of paraplegics who regularly activate their upper limps and
trunk has been suggested to be almost normal in a few studies. The purpose of the
present study was to evaluate the left ventricular dimensions, left ventricular
mass, systolic and diastolic function in adolescent wheelchair-bound basketball
players using echocardio-graphy, and to compare the results with those of sedentary
adolescents unable to use their lower extremities and the results of able bodied
controls. METHODS: The study group consisted of 22 male adolescent high school
students who were unable to use their lower extremities: 11 were members of a high
school basketball team who had been regularly playing basketball for at least 2
years, and 11 were sedentary adolescents none of whom was engaged in any kind of
routine training program. The control group consisted of 11 healthy able-bodied male
adolescents of similar age. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in left
ventricular dimensions and wall thickness, aortic root, left atrium diameters, or
left ventricular filling characteristics between the three groups. Wheelchair-bound
basketball players had increased left ventricular ejection fraction and shortening
fraction compared with the sedentary unable-bodied individuals. Although left
ventricular ejection fractions were significantly lower than in normal adolescents,
all ejection fraction values except one were within the normal limits in the
unable-bodied basketball players. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study
suggest that an upper extremity exercise program and sports such as basketball can
improve the cardiac functions and additional echocardiographic functions of people
unable to use their lower extremities, potentially to normal levels.

24231129	Planned and reactive agility performance in semiprofessional and amateur basketball	"CONTEXT: Research indicates that planned and reactive agility are different athletic skills. These skills have not been adequately assessed in male basketball players.
PURPOSE: To define whether 10-m-sprint performance and planned and reactive agility
measured by the Y-shaped agility test can discriminate between semiprofessional and
amateur basketball players. METHODS: Ten semiprofessional and 10 amateur basketball
players completed 10-m sprints and planned- and reactive-agility tests. The Y-shaped
agility test involved subjects sprinting 5 m through a trigger timing gate, followed
by a 45° cut and 5-m sprint to the left or right through a target gate. In the
planned condition, subjects knew the cut direction. For reactive trials, subjects
visually scanned to find the illuminated gate. A 1-way analysis of variance (P <
.05) determined between-groups differences. Data were pooled (N = 20) for a
correlation analysis (P < .05). RESULTS: The reactive tests differentiated between
the groups; semiprofessional players were 6% faster for the reactive left (P = .036)
and right (P = .029) cuts. The strongest correlations were between the 10-m sprints
and planned-agility tests (r = .590-.860). The reactive left cut did not correlate
with the planned tests. The reactive right cut moderately correlated with the 10-m
sprint and planned right cut (r = .487-.485). CONCLUSIONS: The results reemphasized
that planned and reactive agility are separate physical qualities. Reactive agility
discriminated between the semiprofessional and amateur basketball players; planned
agility did not. To distinguish between male basketball players of different ability
levels, agility tests should include a perceptual and decision-making component.

27022062	Concussion Incidence and Return-to-Play Time in National Basketball Association	"BACKGROUND: Various research efforts have studied concussions in the National Football League, Major League Baseball, and the National Hockey League. However, no
study has investigated the incidence and return-to-play trends in the National
Basketball Association (NBA), which this study aims to do. HYPOTHESIS: Increased
media scrutiny and public awareness, in addition to the institution of a league-wide
concussion protocol, may have resulted in more conservative return-to-play
practices. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: All concussions to
NBA players that were publicly reported in the media from the beginning of the 2006
NBA season to the end of the 2014 season were included. The incidence and
return-to-play statistics were generated by synthesizing information from publicly
available records. RESULTS: There were 134 publicly reported concussions to NBA
players from the beginning of the 2006 season to the conclusion of the 2014 season,
resulting in an average of 14.9 concussions per season. The incidence has not
changed significantly during this time span. The average games missed after a
concussion from 2006 to 2010 was 1.6, significantly less than the 5.0 games missed
from 2011 to 2014, following the institution of the NBA concussion protocol (P =
.023). CONCLUSION: Although the incidence of publicly reported concussions in the
NBA has not changed appreciably over the past 9 seasons, the time missed after a
concussion has. While players often returned in the same game in the 2006 season,
the combination of implemented policy, national coverage, medical staff awareness,
and player education may have contributed to players now missing an average of 4 to
6 games after a concussion. A multitude of factors has resulted in more conservative
return-to-play practices for NBA players after concussions.

29431595	Wheelchair Mobility Performance Enhancement by Changing Wheelchair Properties: What	"PURPOSE: To provide insight on the effect of wheelchair settings on wheelchair mobility performance (WMP). METHODS: Twenty elite wheelchair basketball athletes of
low (n = 10) and high classification (n = 10) were tested in a
wheelchair-basketball-directed field test. Athletes performed the test in their own
wheelchairs, which were modified for 5 additional conditions regarding seat height
(high-low), mass (central-distributed), and grip. The previously developed
inertial-sensor-based WMP monitor was used to extract wheelchair kinematics in all
conditions. RESULTS: Adding mass showed most effect on WMP, with a reduced average
acceleration across all activities. Once distributed, additional mass also reduced
maximal rotational speed and rotational acceleration. Elevating seat height had an
effect on several performance aspects in sprinting and turning, whereas lowering
seat height influenced performance minimally. Increased rim grip did not alter
performance. No differences in response were evident between low- and
high-classified athletes. CONCLUSIONS: The WMP monitor showed sensitivity to detect
performance differences due to the small changes in wheelchair configuration.
Distributed additional mass had the most effect on WMP, whereas additional grip had
the least effect of conditions tested. Performance effects appear similar for both
low- and high-classified athletes. Athletes, coaches, and wheelchair experts are
provided with insight into the performance effect of key wheelchair settings, and
they are offered a proven sensitive method to apply in sport practice, in their
search for the best wheelchair-athlete combination.

25734781	Does Testosterone Modulate Mood States and Physical Performance in Young Basketball	"This study aimed to examine and compare mood states profile and physical performance during different training phases between 2 groups of adolescent basketball players
that were differentiated according to baseline testosterone concentration (T). The
basketball players were submitted to an intensified training period (OVL) followed
by a tapering period (TP). Twenty-three young male basketball players initiated the
study. Experimental criteria data were used to stratify 16 players into
high-testosterone (HTC) or low-testosterone (LTC) concentration groups. All the 16
athletes undertook 5 weeks of OVL followed by a 3-week TP. Saliva sampling, Yo-Yo
intermittent recovery level 1 (Yo-Yo IRL1) test and the T-test were conducted at the
beginning (T1), after OVL (T2), and after TP (T3). A similar increase in internal
training load was observed during OVL when compared with TP in both groups (p <
0.05). No difference in mood states was observed between groups (p > 0.05); however,
LTC displayed a higher score for fatigue (p < 0.05) and a lower score for energy
index (p < 0.05) in OVL, compared with TP. A significant improvement in the Yo-Yo
IRL1 test and the T-test was observed (T1 to T3) (p < 0.05), with no difference
between groups (p > 0.05). In conclusion, these results suggest that LTC athletes
may be more susceptible to changes in mood states during intensified training
periods. In addition, data indicate that a periodized training program successfully
improved the physical performance (endurance and agility) of young basketball
players; however, this improvement was not affected by testosterone level.

States. HYPOTHESIS: Basketball injury rates and patterns differ by gender and type
of exposure. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS:
Basketball-related injury data were collected during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007
academic years from 100 nationally representative US high schools via Reporting
Information Online. RESULTS: High school basketball players sustained 1518 injuries
during 780 651 athlete exposures for an injury rate of 1.94 per 1000 athlete
exposures. The injury rate per 1000 athlete exposures was greater during competition
(3.27) than during practice (1.40; rate ratio, 2.33; 95% confidence interval,
2.10-2.57) and was greater among girls (2.08) than among boys (1.83; rate ratio,
1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.26). The ankle/foot (39.7%), knee (14.7%),
head/face/neck (13.6%), arm/hand (9.6%), and hip/thigh/upper leg (8.4%) were most
commonly injured. The most frequent injury diagnoses were ligament sprains (44.0%),
muscle/tendon strains (17.7%), contusions (8.6%), fractures (8.5%), and concussions
(7.0%). Female basketball players sustained a greater proportion of concussions
(injury proportion ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.49-3.91) and knee
injuries (injury proportion ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.30),
whereas boys more frequently sustained fractures (injury proportion ratio, 1.87; 95%
confidence interval, 1.27-2.77) and contusions (injury proportion ratio, 1.52; 95%
confidence interval, 1.00-2.31). The most common girls' injury requiring surgery was
knee ligament sprains (47.9%). CONCLUSION: High school basketball injury patterns
vary by gender and type of exposure. This study suggests several areas of emphasis
for targeted injury prevention interventions.

purpose of this study is to describe how basketball injuries occur to allow
development of effective countermeasures. METHODS: This study used data derived from
safety reports obtained from the USAF Ground Safety Automated System. Basketball
injuries for the years 1993-2002 that resulted in at least one lost workday were
included in the study conducted in 2003. Narrative data from 32,818 safety reports

mechanisms associated with these injuries. RESULTS: A total of 2204 mishap reports
involving active duty USAF members playing basketball were documented by the study.
This study identified seven mechanisms causing basketball injury. Two similar causes
involving jumping (landing awkwardly and landing on someone's foot) accounted for
43% of basketball injuries followed by collisions with other players (10%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that mechanisms of basketball-related injury can be
identified using the detailed information found in USAF safety reports. Knowledge of
leading hazards or mechanisms for basketball injuries can be used to prioritize and
develop prevention strategies.

26434019	Non-Linear Approach in Kinesiology Should Be Preferred to the Linear--A Case of	"In kinesiology, medicine, biology and psychology, in which research focus is on dynamical self-organized systems, complex connections exist between variables.
Non-linear nature of complex systems has been discussed and explained by the example
of non-linear anthropometric predictors of performance in basketball. Previous
studies interpreted relations between anthropometric features and measures of
effectiveness in basketball by (a) using linear correlation models, and by (b)
including all basketball athletes in the same sample of participants regardless of
their playing position. In this paper the significance and character of linear and
non-linear relations between simple anthropometric predictors (AP) and performance
criteria consisting of situation-related measures of effectiveness (SE) in
basketball were determined and evaluated. The sample of participants consisted of
top-level junior basketball players divided in three groups according to their
playing time (8 minutes and more per game) and playing position: guards (N = 42),
forwards (N = 26) and centers (N = 40). Linear (general model) and non-linear
(general model) regression models were calculated simultaneously and separately for
each group. The conclusion is viable: non-linear regressions are frequently superior
to linear correlations when interpreting actual association logic among research
variables.

24965214	Judgement bias in predicting the success of one's own basketball free throws but not	"Skilled basketball players are supposed to hit more often from the free throw distance than would be predicted by their shooting performances at adjacent
distances. This is dubbed an especial skill. In the current study, we examined
whether especial skills in free throw performance in basketball map onto especial
skills in visually judging the success of basketball free throws. In addition, we
tested whether this effect would be present in those who predict their own shots but
absent in those who judge shots performed by another person. Eight skilled
basketball players were coupled with eight equally skilled players, and performed
150 set shots from five different distances (including the free throw distance)
while the yoked partner observed the shots. At the moment of ball release, the
performers' and the observers' vision were synchronously occluded using
liquid-crystal occlusion goggles, and both independently judged whether the shot was
successful or not. Results did not replicate an especial skill effect in shooting
performance. Based on signal detection theory (SDT) measures (d' and criterion c),
results also revealed no especial skill for visually discriminating successful from
unsuccessful shots at the foul line when compared to other distances. However,
players showed an especial skill judgement bias towards judging balls 'in' at the
foul line, but not at other distances. Importantly, this bias was only present in
those who judged the success of their own shots, but not in those who judged the
shots performed by someone else.

23455891	Assessment of the effect of anthropometric data on the alterations of cardiovascular	"OBJECTIVES. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of the anthropometric data of basketball players on the alterations of cardiovascular parameters during the
physical load applying the model of integrated evaluation. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The
research sample consisted of 113 healthy Caucasian male basketball players,
candidates of the Lithuanian National men's basketball teams. Basketball players
were divided into 2 groups: 69 taller and heavier male basketball players (with a
higher percentage of body fat) (TMB) and 44 shorter and less heavy male basketball
players (with a lower percentage of body fat) (SMB). The amount of fat, expressed in
percentage, was measured using the body composition analyzer TBF-300. ""Kaunas-Load,""
a computerized ECG analysis system, was used to evaluate the functional condition of
the cardiovascular system during the load. RESULTS. The TMB group had a lower heart
rate during the warming-up phase and the steady state of the load as compared with
the SMB group (P<0.05). The JT interval in the TMB group was greater during the
warming-up and the steady state as compared with the SMB group (P<0.05). The JT/RR
ratio index in the TMB group was found to be lower in the warming-up phase and in
the steady state compared with the respective parameter in the SMB group (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS. The cardiovascular system of taller and heavier male basketball players
with a greater relative amount of body fat functioned more economically.

23479394	Activity profiles and demands of seasonal and tournament basketball competition.	"Competition-specific conditioning for tournament basketball games is challenging, as the demands of tournament formats are not well characterized. PURPOSE: To compare
the physical, physiological, and tactical demands of seasonal and tournament
basketball competition and determine the pattern of changes within an international
tournament. METHODS: Eight elite junior male basketball players (age 17.8 ± 0.2 y,
height 1.93 ± 0.07 m, mass 85 ± 3 kg; mean ± SD) were monitored in 6 seasonal games
played over 4 mo in an Australian second-division national league and in 7 games of
an international under-18 tournament played over 8 days. Movement patterns and
tactical elements were coded from video and heart rates recorded by telemetry.
RESULTS: The frequency of running, sprinting, and shuffling movements in seasonal
games was higher than in tournament games by 8-15% (99% confidence limits ± ~8%).
Within the tournament, jogging and low- to medium-intensity shuffling decreased by
15-20% (± ~14%) over the 7 games, while running, sprinting, and high-intensity
shuffling increased 11-81% (± ~25%). There were unclear differences in mean and peak
heart rates. The total number of possessions was higher in seasonal than in
tournament games by 8% (± 10%). CONCLUSIONS: Coaches should consider a stronger
emphasis on strength and power training in their conditioning programs to account
for the higher activity of seasonal games. For tournament competition, strategies
that build a sufficient aerobic capacity and neuromuscular resilience to maintain
high-intensity movements need to be employed. A focus on half-court tactics accounts
for the lower number of possessions in tournaments.

31955031	Cognitive load reduces interference by head fakes in basketball.	"The head fake in basketball is a deceptive action in sports, where an attacking basketball player gazes in one direction (irrelevant component), but passes the ball
to the opposite direction (relevant component). A defending player, who aims to
respond to the relevant information displayed by the opponent, faces a situation
conceptually similar to well-known interference paradigms (e.g., Stroop task,
Eriksen flanker task). Previous research has shown that responses to pass directions
are slower and more error prone for head fakes than for direct passes (so called
head-fake effect). The head-fake effect depends on participants' ability to focus
attention on the relevant stimulus feature. As maintaining this attentional focus
conceivably bears on limited capacities, we tested if taxing these capacities by a
cognitively demanding concurrent task would change the impact of task-irrelevant
information and thus, the size of the head-fake effect. Moreover, we investigated
the impact of such a concurrent task on post-conflict control (i.e., the congruency
sequence effect). The results show that a concurrent task reduces the head-fake
effect, while post-conflict control was unaffected. We discuss these findings with
regard to the relationship of working memory processes and selective attention.

27710197	Improved children's motor learning of the basketball free shooting pattern by	"This study aimed at assessing the interaction between subjective error estimation and frequency of extrinsic feedback in the learning of the basketball free shooting
pattern by children. 10- to 12-year olds were assigned to 1 of 4 groups combining
subjective error estimation and relative frequency of extrinsic feedback
(33% × 100%). Analysis of performance was based on quality of movement pattern.
Analysis showed superior learning of the group combining error estimation and 100%
feedback frequency, both groups receiving feedback on 33% of trials achieved
intermediate results, and the group combining no requirement of error estimation and
100% feedback frequency had the poorest learning. Our results show the benefit of
subjective error estimation in association with high frequency of extrinsic feedback
in children's motor learning of a sport motor pattern.

24908360	Time trends for injuries and illness, and their relation to performance in the	"OBJECTIVES: To survey injury/illness in the National Basketball Association over a 25-year period and examine the relationship of injury/illness to team performance.
DESIGN: A retrospective correlational design. METHODS: Trends were examined in
reported numbers of players injured/ill during a season and games missed due to
injury/illness from seasons ending in 1986 through 2005. This period was compared to
years 2006-2010, when NBA teams were allowed to increase the total number of players
on the team from 12 to 15. RESULTS: There was a highly significant trend (p<0.0001)
of increasing numbers of players injured/ill and games missed from 1986 through
2005. After the team expansion in 2006, these rates fell abruptly by 13% and 39%
respectively (both p<0.0001 compared to the previous 5-year period). We also found a
significant inverse association between games missed due to injury/illness and
percent games won (r=-0.29, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate an increased
rate of injury in the National Basketball Association up until the expansion of team
size in 2006. Following 2006, team expansion was positively associated with
decreased injury/illness rates. The latter finding suggests the importance of
maintaining a healthy roster with respect to winning outcomes.

22295109	The problem of shot selection in basketball.	"In basketball, every time the offense produces a shot opportunity the player with the ball must decide whether the shot is worth taking. In this article, I explore
the question of when a team should shoot and when they should pass up the shot by
considering a simple theoretical model of the shot selection process, in which the
quality of shot opportunities generated by the offense is assumed to fall randomly
within a uniform distribution. Within this model I derive an answer to the question
""how likely must the shot be to go in before the player should take it?"" and I show
that this lower cutoff for shot quality f depends crucially on the number n of shot
opportunities remaining (say, before the shot clock expires), with larger n
demanding that only higher-quality shots should be taken. The function f(n) is also
derived in the presence of a finite turnover rate and used to predict the shooting
rate of an optimal-shooting team as a function of time. The theoretical prediction
for the optimal shooting rate is compared to data from the National Basketball
Association (NBA). The comparison highlights some limitations of the theoretical
model, while also suggesting that NBA teams may be overly reluctant to shoot the
ball early in the shot clock.

17548370	Assessing basketball ability in players with mental retardation.	"BACKGROUND: Although athletes with mental retardation (MR) have achieved an important role, literature concerning the evaluation tests in basketball is still
poor. OBJECTIVE: To assess basketball ability before and after a 4-month training
performed before championship for athletes with MR and to correlate ability
variations with MR levels. METHODS: 15 trained basketball players with MR (11 men
and 4 women; age range 21-43 years; MR: 3 mild, 8 moderate, 8 severe and 1
profound). Athletes were tested before (pre) and after (post) 4 month training
preceding the championship. The tests assessed 4 levels of ability, each one
characterised by 4 fundamental areas of this game: ball handling, reception, passing
and shooting. Each area was divided into 5 specific components. RESULTS: The team
average score, based on the score of each athlete's 4 levels, improved by 6.6 points
(41.6 (SD 11.9) vs 48.2 (14.7)). The comparison between pre and post scores in each
level showed increases (p<0.01), especially in level II (14.4 (3.5) vs 16.5 (3.3))
and in level III (7.1 (5.7) vs 9.2 (6.6)). Within level II, ball handling (3.67
(1.2) vs 4.37 (0.5); p<0.05) and passing (3.20 (1.2) vs 3.97 (1.3); p<0.01)
improved; in level III reception (3.21 (1.1) vs 3.73 (1.1); p = 0.01) and shooting
(1.82 (1.1) vs 2.45 (1.3); p<0.05) increased. CONCLUSIONS: A 4 month training caused
a general improvement, especially evident in levels II and III. Total score reached
in level II was negatively correlated with MR level (r = -0.56; p<0.05), indicating
that athletes with lower MR obtained higher scores.

25726151	Influence of wheel configuration on wheelchair basketball performance: wheel	"The aim of the current investigation was to explore the lateral stiffness of different sports wheelchair wheels available to athletes in 'new' and 'used'
conditions and to determine the effect of (a) stiffness, (b) tyre type (clincher vs.
tubular) and (c) tyre orientation on the physiological and biomechanical responses
to submaximal and maximal effort propulsion specific to wheelchair basketball. Eight
able-bodied individuals participated in the laboratory-based testing, which took
place on a wheelchair ergometer at two fixed speeds (1.1 and 2.2 m s(-1)). Outcome
measures were power output and physiological demand (oxygen uptake and heart rate).
Three participants with experience of over-ground sports wheelchair propulsion also
performed 2 × 20 m sprints in each wheel configuration. Results revealed that wheels
differed significantly in lateral stiffness with the 'new' Spinergy wheel shown to
be the stiffest (678.2 ± 102.1 N mm(-1)). However the effects of stiffness on
physiological demand were minimal compared to tyre type whereby tubular tyres
significantly reduced the rolling resistance and power output in relation to
clincher tyres. Therefore tyre type (and subsequently inflation pressure) remains
the most important aspect of wheel specification for athletes to consider and
monitor when configuring a sports wheelchair.

22146388	Reinforcement learning in professional basketball players.	"Reinforcement learning in complex natural environments is a challenging task because the agent should generalize from the outcomes of actions taken in one state of the
world to future actions in different states of the world. The extent to which human
experts find the proper level of generalization is unclear. Here we show, using the
sequences of field goal attempts made by professional basketball players, that the
outcome of even a single field goal attempt has a considerable effect on the rate of
subsequent 3 point shot attempts, in line with standard models of reinforcement
learning. However, this change in behaviour is associated with negative correlations
between the outcomes of successive field goal attempts. These results indicate that
despite years of experience and high motivation, professional players overgeneralize
from the outcomes of their most recent actions, which leads to decreased
performance.

26667896	Space occupation near the basket shapes collective behaviours in youth basketball.	"This study aimed to analyse how youth basketball players explored numerical overloads during shot attempts by measuring their space occupation across specific
court areas. Four process-tracing variables measured how the number of attackers
(NA), number of defenders (ND), interpersonal distance between attacker and the
closest defender (ID) and distance between attacker and the basket (DBkt) impacted
on the performance outcome (converted shot; missed shot; ball possession lost). Ten
competitive games involving 13 U14 teams were video recorded and players'
displacements were digitised. The associations between performance outcomes and the
process-tracing measures were assessed using standardised mean differences and a
cross-correlation function. A multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate
the odds ratio (OR) for each of the three possible outcomes. Results revealed that
when shot attempts occurred at larger ID and at smaller DBkt, the possibilities to
obtain a converted shot increased. The numerical overload of defenders near the
scoring target was predominantly associated with offensive success. Also, the
possibility of attackers to lead the spatial relation of movements with the
defenders, near the scoring target, appeared as a prominent strategy to succeed. In
sum, basketball teams that exhibit potential to adapt their collective behaviours to
local changes in the environment might be closer to achieving successful outcomes.

25752918	The level of selected coordinative motor abilities of basketball players aged 16-18.	"AIM: Coordinative abilities play a very important role in sport. Unfortunately, researchers do not confine appropriate attention to this issue. Therefore, the aim
of this study was an attempt at analysing results of the selected coordinative motor
abilities: kinesthetic differentiation, quick reaction and spatial orientation. It
was intended to find out whether the results of trials determining manifestations of
the particular coordinative abilities exhibit any mutual relationships. Forasmuch as
a static torque is a parameter determining the level of force components of the
ability of kinaesthetic differentiation, it would like to find out whether its
maximum level influences the final result. METHODS: Research was carried out on 20
young basketball players with the use of a torque meter and Fusion Smart Speed
System. RESULTS: It was noticed a lack of statistically significant relationships
between the results of trials assessing manifestations of the ability of
kinaesthetic differentiation, quick reaction and spatial orientation. However, it
was noted statistically significant correlation between the maximum static torque
and the accuracy of releasing a particular value of a static torque. CONCLUSION: The
accuracy of releasing a particular value of a static torque ought to be classified
as a comprehensive ability that comprises manifestations of strength abilities and
kinaesthetic differentiation. Presented trials to evaluation manifestations of the
selected coordinative abilities could be used by coaches during a training process.
Coaches should also focus on the development of muscle strength of the upper body
and upper limbs of basketball players.

25675272	Retention of quiet eye in older skilled basketball players.	"There is mounting research to suggest that cognitive and motor expertise is more resistant to age-related decline than more general capacities. The authors
investigated the retention of skills in medium-aged skilled (n = 14) and older-aged
skilled (n = 7) athletes by comparing them with medium-aged less skilled (n = 15)
and older-aged less skilled (n = 15) participants. Participants performed basketball
free throws and dart throws as a transfer task under standardized conditions. Motor
performance (accuracy) and perceptual performance (quiet eye) were examined across
the four groups. There were significant differences between skill groups and age
groups in throwing accuracy on both throwing tasks. Skilled players outperformed
less skilled and medium-aged players outperformed older-aged players in basketball
and dart throws. There were no significant differences in quiet eye duration across
the skill or age groups in either task. These results indicate expertise in a
perceptual motor task such as the basketball free throw can be retained in older
athletes and that present models of skill maintenance should be re-evaluated to
consider the issue of transfer.

31905223	The effects of sport expertise and shot results on basketball players' action	"The purpose of the present cross-sectional study was to clarify the effects of sport expertise and shot results on the action anticipation of basketball players.
Eighty-eight male subjects participated in this study, namely, 30 collegiate
basketball players, 28 recreational basketball players and 30 non-athletes. Each
participant performed a shot anticipation task in which he watched the shooting
phase, rising phase, high point and falling phase of a free throw and predicted the
fate of the ball. The results showed that the collegiate players and recreational
players demonstrated higher accuracy than the non-athletes for the falling phase but
not for the other temporal conditions. Analysis of the shot results demonstrated
that for made shots, the collegiate players and recreational players provided more
accurate predictions than the non-athletes. These results suggested that the
experienced players required a sufficient amount of information to be able to make
accurate judgements and demonstrated that the experts' judgement bias for made shots
was independent of the temporal condition.

positions, classification and performance of the male and female participants
(n = 2395) of the U16, U18 and U20 European Basketball Championships were analysed.
We found an over-representation of players born during the initial months of the
year in all groups, with the relative age effect being more evident in players of
the U16 and U18 groups, than of the U20 teams, particularly in male squads.
Nevertheless, in the U20 championships, those teams that had the oldest players
performed the best. In all championships, the oldest participants played more
minutes. In addition, relatively older male players scored better in total points
and in performance index rating when results were normalised to played time. This
effect was not found for female players. Regarding playing position, different
distributions of birth dates were observed due to each position's physical
requirements. Thus, basketball coaches and managers should keep these results in
mind when they select players because if not, they might subject players who are
born towards the end of the year to a negative selection bias.

26595130	Physiological and Technical Demands of No Dribble Game Drill in Young Basketball	"This study assessed the physiological and technical demands of no dribble game drill (NDGD) in comparison with a regular drill (RD). Twenty-three young basketball
players performed RDs and NDGDs in a random order. All basketball rules were
followed for RDs, whereas dribbling was not permitted for NDGDs. The independent
variable was the drill condition, and the dependent variables were percentage of
maximal heart rate (%HRmax), rate of perceived exertion (RPE), Edwards training load
(TL), and the following technical actions (TAs): pass (total, correct, wrong, and
percent of correct passes), shot (total, scored, missed, and percent of made shots),
interception, steal, turnover, and rebound. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were applied
to assess differences between NDGD and RD conditions for each dependent variable,
and the level of statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Results showed higher
values for %HRmax (p = 0.007), Edwards TL (p = 0.006), and RPE (p = 0.027) in NDGD
compared with RD condition. Technical action analysis revealed higher values in NDGD
than RD for total (p = 0.000), correct (p = 0.000), and wrong pass (p = 0.005), and
interception (p = 0.001), whereas no significant differences were found for the
other TAs. The main finding of this study was that NDGD condition elicited a greater
physiological demand and a higher number of passes and interceptions than the RD
one. Basketball coaches should consider the NDGD as a viable method to increase the
physiological load of their training sessions and to teach passing skills in a
game-based situation.

30102870	Perfectionism and training performance: The mediating role of other-approach goals.	"Recent research found perfectionistic strivings to predict performance in a novel basketball task among novice basketball players. The current study builds on this
research by examining whether this is also the case for performance in a familiar
basketball training task among experienced basketball players, and whether
achievement goals mediated any observed relationships. Perfectionistic strivings,
perfectionistic concerns, and 3 × 2 achievement goals were assessed prior to
basketball training performance in 90 basketball players (mean age 20.9 years).
Regression analyses showed that perfectionistic strivings predicted better
performance. Furthermore, mediation analyses showed that other-approach goals (e.g.
beliefs that one should and can outperform others) accounted for this relationship.
The findings suggest that perfectionistic strivings may predict better performance
in both novel and familiar athletic contexts. In addition, beliefs about the
importance and ability to outperform others may explain this relationship.

(mean ± SD, age: 26.3 ± 6.7 years; stature: 188.1 ± 6.2 cm; body mass: 92.0 ± 13.8
kg) were monitored across a 7-week period during the preparatory phase of the annual
training plan. A total of 44 total sessions were monitored. Player session ratings
of perceived exertion (sRPE), heart rate, and accelerometer data were collected
across each training session. Internal training load was determined using the sRPE,
training impulse (TRIMP), and summated-heart-rate-zones (SHRZ) training load models.
External training load was calculated using an established accelerometer algorithm.
Pearson product-moment correlations with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to
determine the relationships between internal and external training load models.
Significant moderate relationships were observed between external training load and
the sRPE (r42 = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.23-0.69, p < 0.001) and TRIMP models (r42 = 0.38,
95% CI = 0.09-0.61, p = 0.011). A significant large correlation was evident between
external training load and the SHRZ model (r42 = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.38-0.77, p <
0.001). Although significant relationships were found between internal and external
training load models, the magnitude of the correlations and low commonality suggest
that internal training load models measure different constructs of the training
process than the accelerometer training load model in basketball settings.
Basketball coaching and conditioning professionals should not assume a linear
dose-response between accelerometer and internal training load models during
training and are recommended to combine internal and external approaches when
monitoring training load in players.

question. We determined the effects of 4 different warm-up protocols followed by 20
minutes of basketball activity on flexibility and vertical jump height. Subjects
participated in 6 weeks (2 times per week) of warm-up and basketball activity. The
warm-up groups participated in ballistic stretching, static stretching, sprinting,

does 6 weeks of warm-up exercise and basketball play have on both flexibility and
vertical jump height? We measured sit and reach and vertical jump height before
(week -1) and after (week 7) the 6 weeks. Flexibility increased for the ballistic,
static, and sprint groups compared to the control group (p < 0.0001), while vertical
jump height did not change for any of the groups. Our second question was what is
the acute effect of each warm-up on vertical jump height? We measured vertical jump
immediately after the warm-up on 4 separate occasions during the 6 weeks (at weeks
0, 2, 4, and 6). Vertical jump height was not different for any group. Finally, our
third question was what is the acute effect of each warm-up on vertical jump height

immediately following 20 minutes of basketball play at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6. Only
the ballistic stretching group demonstrated an acute increase in vertical jump 20
minutes after basketball play (p < 0.05). Coaches should consider using ballistic
stretching as a warm-up for basketball play, as it is beneficial to vertical jump
performance.

players' motivation were also investigated. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: This study took place over the course of a 5-day organized youth sport
(OYS) basketball program in 2 sports centres in Greater Western Sydney, Australia
(September, 2013). A convenience sample of 76 players and 8 coaches were recruited.
Players were girls aged 9 to 12 years. Following the first 2 days of the basketball
program, coaches allocated into the intervention condition attended 2 coach
education sessions where strategies to increase moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) and decrease inactivity were discussed. Each coach education session
lasted approximately 2h. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, players in the
intervention group spent a significantly higher proportion of practice time in MVPA
(mean difference [MD]=14.6%; standard error [SE]=2.2%), vigorous PA (VPA; MD=12.6%;
SE=1.9%), moderate PA (MD=2.0%; SE=0.5%) and a significantly lower proportion of
practice time inactive (MD=-14.5%; SE=2.3%) from baseline to follow-up. There were
no significant changes in motivation from baseline to follow-up in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Brief coach education sessions can increase MVPA and decrease
inactivity without deleterious effects on players' motivation. Also, substantial
increases in VPA were found, which is an important finding because VPA has been
associated with health benefits, over and above benefits accrued from
lower-intensity activity.

trials of each movement in three identical shoes of varying midsole hardness (soft,
medium, hard). Vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) during landing was sampled
using multiple wooden-top force plates. Perceptual responses on five variables

step of the layup, the loading rate associated with rearfoot contact was 40.7%
higher in the ""heavy"" than ""light"" groups (P = .014) and 12.4% higher in hard
compared with soft shoes (P = .011). Forefoot peak VGRF in a soft shoe was higher

120°/s increasing the chances of ankle injuries in basketball players. There was no
correlation between ankle strength and balance in both dominant and non-dominant
limbs.

25051006	Time-motion analysis of Italian elite women's basketball games: individual and team	"The aim of this study was to assess elite women's basketball game performance. Five elite women's games (3 Italian first division and 2 Euroleague) were analyzed for
individual and team time-motion analyses. The individual analysis evaluated the
players' movement patterns with particular focus on high-intensity activity (HIA),
sprint activity, and repeated sprint events (RSEs). Team analysis included live time
(LT), stoppage time (ST), and their ratio, transfer (TR) phases, and half court and
full court actions. The frequency of occurrence of changes of activities was n = 576
± 110, one every 2.56 seconds of LT. Total HIA was 8.5 ± 1.8% of LT and no
significant differences between quarter periods were observed. In general, players
performed linear sprints (48.3 ± 2.9%) over 1-5 m distance (56.8 ± 5.6%). The
occurrence of RSE was 4.4 ± 1.7, with 58.6 ± 18.5% passive recovery between sprints.
Team analysis showed no significant difference between games for LT and ST phases
(ratio = 1.18 ± 0.25). For game analysis, LT and ST were 43.4 ± 7.8% and 51.1 ±
8.4%, respectively. A difference between games was found for half court actions (p <
0.01) and TR phases (p ≤ 0.05). Moreover, 1 TR and 2 TR were the most performed
(45.3 and 23.9%) actions. These results encourage coaches to include repeated sprint
ability with mainly linear and short sprints into a comprehensive training program.

26351846	A Method for Using Player Tracking Data in Basketball to Learn Player Skills and	"Player tracking data represents a revolutionary new data source for basketball analysis, in which essentially every aspect of a player's performance is tracked and
can be analyzed numerically. We suggest a way by which this data set, when coupled
with a network-style model of the offense that relates players' skills to the team's
success at running different plays, can be used to automatically learn players'
skills and predict the performance of untested 5-man lineups in a way that accounts
for the interaction between players' respective skill sets. After developing a
general analysis procedure, we present as an example a specific implementation of
our method using a simplified network model. While player tracking data is not yet
available in the public domain, we evaluate our model using simulated data and show
that player skills can be accurately inferred by a simple statistical inference
scheme. Finally, we use the model to analyze games from the 2011 playoff series
between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Oklahoma City Thunder and we show that, even
with a very limited data set, the model can consistently describe a player's
interactions with a given lineup based only on his performance with a different
lineup.

32122274	Bayesian hierarchical modelling of basketball tracking data - a case study of	"Spatio-temporal data in sport is increasing rapidly, however suitable statistical methods for analysing this data are underdeveloped. The current study establishes
the need for spatial statistical methods, propose a Bayesian hierarchical model as
an appropriate method for comparing spatial variables, and test this model across
three spatial scales. The need for spatial statistical methods was established
through the identification of spatial autocorrelation. This necessitated the use of
a Bayesian hierarchical model to test for an association between spatial ball
movement entropy and spatial effectiveness. Posterior distribution results showed a
generally positive association such that increases in entropy were associated with
increases in effectiveness. The strength and confidence of the associations were
impacted by the spatial scale, with the 6 × 6 grid showing the most conclusive
evidence of a positive relationship; the 4 × 4 grid was mostly positive, however
with a large variation; and finally, the basket-centric scale results were less
conclusive. The results of the current study demonstrate the suitability of a
Bayesian hierarchical model for testing for associations or differences between
spatial variables. With the increase in spatial analyses in sport, this study
presents an appropriate statistical method for dealing with complex problems
associated with spatial analyses.

24015713	The influence of physical and cognitive factors on reactive agility performance in	"This study explored the influence of physical and cognitive measures on reactive agility performance in basketball players. Twelve men basketball players performed
multiple sprint, Change of Direction Speed Test, and Reactive Agility Test trials.
Pearson's correlation analyses were used to determine relationships between the
predictor variables (stature, mass, body composition, 5-m, 10-m and 20-m sprint
times, peak speed, closed-skill agility time, response time and decision-making
time) and reactive agility time (response variable). Simple and stepwise regression
analyses determined the individual influence of each predictor variable and the best
predictor model for reactive agility time. Morphological (r = -0.45 to 0.19), sprint
(r = -0.40 to 0.41) and change-of-direction speed measures (r = 0.43) had small to
moderate correlations with reactive agility time. Response time (r = 0.76, P =
0.004) and decision-making time (r = 0.58, P = 0.049) had large to very large
relationships with reactive agility time. Response time was identified as the sole
predictor variable for reactive agility time in the stepwise model (R(2) = 0.58, P =
0.004). In conclusion, cognitive measures had the greatest influence on reactive
agility performance in men basketball players. These findings suggest reaction and
decision-making drills should be incorporated in basketball training programmes.

24816890	Effect of defensive pressure on movement behaviour during an under-18 basketball	"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of defensive pressure on movement behaviour during an under-18 basketball game. 20 international male players (age:
M=16.05, SD=2.09 years old; weekly practice: M=10.9, SD=1.94 h; playing experience:
M=7.1, SD=1.1 years) played two 10-min basketball quarters, using man-to-man ¼-court
for the first 4 min (F¼), man-to-man full court defence for the next 3 min (FULL),
and man-to-man ¼-court defence for the last 3 min (S¼). The positional data were
captured by the Ubisense Real Time Location System and analysed with non-linear
signal processing methods (approximate entropy) and repeated measures ANOVA. There
were differences in the regularity values between F¼ and FULL in distance to the
basket and to the opponents' basket. A stronger in-phase attraction in both lateral
and longitudinal directions was identified; however, the centroids (i. e., the mean
position from all team players) were closer and revealed higher values of
irregularity in lateral displacements for all defensive systems. The individual
speed displacements became more coordinated with teammates, particularly in the
offensive court. Overall, this study provided evidence on how changing the level of
defensive pressure promotes different collective behaviours.

training protocols has become central. The present study focuses on junior
wheelchair basketball and aims at (i) proposing a method to identify biomechanical
performance indicators of wheelchair propulsion using an instrumented in-field test
and (ii) developing a training program specific for the considered population and
assessing its efficacy using the proposed method. Twelve athletes (10 M, 2 F, age =
17.1 ± 2.7 years, years of practice = 4.5 ± 1.8) equipped with wheelchair- and
wrist-mounted inertial sensors performed a 20-metre sprint test. Biomechanical
parameters related to propulsion timing, progression force, and coordination were
estimated from the measured accelerations and used in a regression model where the
time to complete the test was set as dependent variable. Force- and
coordination-related parameters accounted for 80% of the dependent variable
variance. Based on these results, a training program was designed and administered
for three months to six of the athletes (the others acting as control group). The
biomechanical indicators proved to be effective in providing additional information
about the wheelchair propulsion technique with respect to the final test outcome and
demonstrated the efficacy of the developed program.

25932983	Fluctuations in Activity Demands Across Game Quarters in Professional and	"Examination of activity demands and stoppage durations across game periods provides useful insight concerning fatigue, tactical strategies, and playing pace in team
sports such as basketball. Therefore, the aims of this study were to quantify and
compare game activity fluctuations across quarters in professional and
semiprofessional basketball players. Video-based time-motion analyses were conducted
across multiple games. Frequencies, total durations (in seconds), total distances
(in meters), and mean velocities (in meters per second) were calculated for
low-intensity movement (≤3 m·s), high-intensity movement (>3 m·s), shuffling, and
dribbling activity. Frequencies were determined for jumping and upper-body activity;
stoppage durations were also calculated. Separate repeated-measures analysis of
variance and Cohen's d were used to identify significant differences and quantify
the effect sizes between game quarters for all outcome measures, respectively.
Pearson correlation analyses were performed to determine the relationship between
stoppage duration and all activity measures. The results showed significantly (p ≤
0.05) reduced dribbling (3.09 ± 0.03 m·s vs. 2.81 ± 0.01 m·s) and total (2.22 ± 0.04
m·s vs. 2.09 ± 0.03 m·s) activity velocities during the third compared with the
first quarter in professional players. Furthermore, effect size analyses showed
greater decreases in high-intensity (professional: d = 1.7-5.4; semiprofessional: d
= 0.3-1.7), shuffling (professional: d = 2.3-3.2; semiprofessional: d = 1.4-2.1),
and total (professional: d = 1.0-4.9; semiprofessional: d = 0.3-0.8) activity and
increases in dribbling (professional: d = 1.4-4.7; semiprofessional: d = 2.5-2.8)
with game progression in professional players. In semiprofessional players, stoppage
duration was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) related to various low-intensity (R =
0.64-0.72), high-intensity (R = 0.65-0.72), and total (R = 0.63-0.73) activity
measures. Although not directly measured, the observed game activity fluctuations
were likely because of a combination of physiological (e.g., muscle glycogen
depletion, dehydration), tactical (e.g., ball control, game pace), and game-related
(e.g., time-outs, player fouls) factors. Basketball coaches can use the provided
data to (a) develop more precise training plans and management strategies, (b)
elevate semiprofessional player performance closer to the professional level, and
(c) incorporate tactical strategies to maximize the benefits of stoppages.

31680306	Jump-landing mechanics in patellar tendinopathy in elite youth basketballers.	"Patellar tendinopathy (PT) is a leading cause of morbidity in jump-landing athletes. Landing mechanics are identified as a factor associated with PT and/or patellar
tendon abnormality. This study aimed to identify key jump-landing variables
associated with PT. Thirty-six junior elite basketball players (men n = 18, women
n = 18) were recruited from a Basketball Australia development camp.
Three-dimensional (3D) kinematic and ground reaction force (GRF) data during a
stop-jump task were collected as well as ultrasound scans of the patellar tendons
and recall history of training load data. Mixed-model factorial analyses of variance
were used to determine any significant between-group differences. Of the 23
participants included for statistical analyses, 11 had normal bilateral patellar
tendons (controls) and eight reported PT (currently symptomatic); however, the four
participants categorized as asymptomatic with patellar tendon abnormality on
diagnostic imaging were excluded from statistical analyses due to their small sample
size. Athletes with PT displayed a similar knee flexion angle at initial foot-ground
contact (IC) and hip extension strategy during a stop-jump horizontal landing.
Despite a similar kinematic technique, athletes with PT utilized a strategy of a
longer stance duration phase from IC to peak force. This strategy did not lead to
those athletes with PT decreasing their peak vertical GRF nor patellar tendon force
during landing but enabled these athletes to land with a lower rate of loading
(control 59.2 ± 39.3 vs. PT 29.4 ± 33.7 BW.s-1). Athletes with PT still reported
significantly reduced training volume (control 4.9 ± 1.8 vs PT 1.8 ± 1.1
sessions/wk; total training time/wk control 2.4 ± 1.0 vs PT 1.4 ± 1.1 h/wk).

26023808	The Effects of Frontal- and Sagittal-Plane Plyometrics on Change-of-Direction Speed	"Plyometrics is a popular training modality for basketball players to improve power and change-of-direction speed. Most plyometric training has used sagittal-plane
exercises, but improvements in change-of-direction speed have been greater in
multi-direction programs. PURPOSE: To determine the benefits of a 6-wk frontal-plane
plyometric (FPP) training program compared with a 6-wk sagittal-plane plyometric
(SPP) training program with regard to power and change-of-direction speed. METHODS:
Fourteen female varsity high school basketball players participated in the study.
Multiple 2 × 2 repeated-measures ANOVAs were used to determine differences for the
FPP and SPP groups from preintervention to postintervention on 4 tests of power and
2 tests of change-of-direction speed. RESULTS: There was a group main effect for
time in all 6 tests. There was a significant group × time interaction effect in 3 of
the 6 tests. The SPP improved performance of the countermovement vertical jump more
than the FPP, whereas the FPP improved performance of the lateral hop (left) and
lateral-shuffle test (left) more than the SPP. The standing long jump, lateral hop
(right), and lateral-shuffle test (right) did not show a significant interaction
effect. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that basketball players should
incorporate plyometric training in all planes to improve power and
change-of-direction speed.

19966588	Knee valgus angle during landing tasks in female volleyball and basketball players.	"Increased knee valgus angles have been associated with an increased risk of a variety of knee injuries. It has yet to be established if knee valgus angles during
jump landing tasks differ between jumping sports with relatively higher and lower
knee injury rates-namely, basketball and volleyball. Any difference in knee angles
on landing may be related to sport-specific differences, which may in turn relate to
the different injury risk rates. Fifteen elite female basketball and volleyball
players had their knee valgus angles assessed during 2 landing tasks: 1 bilateral
(drop jump landing) and 1 unilateral (step landing task). During the drop jump task
knee valgus angle was significantly greater in the basketball group (p = 0.017) in
the right knee, but there was no significant difference in performance between
sports in the left knee (p = 0.67). During the step landing task volleyball players
had significantly greater knee valgus angles than basketball players for both the
left (p = 0.018) and right (p = 0.025) knees. The basketball group showed superior
control of knee valgus during the unilateral task, which may be related to
sport-specific skills. The basketball players showed significant asymmetry in knee
valgus angle during bilateral drop jump landings; this finding reflects those of
previous studies and may be related to the relative increased knee injury risk
reported for this population group.

effect of specific abilities on player efficiency in young basketball players
(cadets). A battery of 12 tests assessing basic motor abilities and 5 specific tests
assessing basketball efficiency were used on a sample of 83 basketball players. Two
significant canonical correlations, i.e. linear combinations explained the relation
between the set of twelve variables of basic motor space and five variables of
situational motor abilities. Underlying the first canonical linear combination is
the positive effect of the general motor factor, predominantly defined by jumping
explosive power, movement speed of the arms, static strength of the arms and
coordination, on specific basketball abilities: movement efficiency, the power of
the overarm throw, shooting and passing precision, and the skill of handling the
ball. The impact of basic motor abilities of precision and balance on specific
abilities of passing and shooting precision and ball handling is underlying the
second linear combination. The results of regression correlation analysis between
the variable set of specific motor abilities and game efficiency have shown that the
ability of ball handling has the largest impact on player quality in basketball
cadets, followed by shooting precision and passing precision, and the power of the
overarm throw.

test results in young male handball and basketball players. The subjects included 34
handball and 38 basketball players of the 10-11 years old age group, 39 handball and
22 basketball players of the 12-13 years old age group and 39 handball players of
the 14-15 years old age group. Body height and body mass, arms' span, height with
outstretched hands and sitting height were the basic anthropometric parameters to be
measured. For hand anthropometry, 15 specific hand parameters were measured using
the method presented by Visnapuu & Jürimäe (2007). Stepwise multiple regression
analysis indicated that medicine ball throw results in the youngest age group are
highly dependent on the body height (handball players) and body mass (basketball
players). In the middle age group, the most important parameter from the hand
anthropometry is TL (handball) or height with outstretched hands (basketball). In
the oldest group of handball players, the medicine ball throw results were dependent
on the P2 from hand anthropometry and sitting height. Quite different anthropometric
parameters appeared to influence the handball or basketball throw results. In the
youngest age group, most important were body height (handball) or LFL (basketball).
In the middle age group, the most important was height with outstretched hands and
in the oldest handball players LFL and sitting height. Handball or basketball pass
on speed depended on the combination of body mass and FS5 and body height with
height with outstretched hands (even 61.40%, R2 x 100) in the oldest age group. The
results of passing the handball or basketball on precision were dependent on body
height and P3 or P1 among basketball players in the youngest group. In the middle
age group the combination of FS3 and body mass and LFL and height with outstretched
hands were the most influential. Anthropometric parameters influence on the passing
of the ball on speed or precision is lower in handball players compared with
basketball players. Our conclusion is that the basic anthropometric parameters are
slightly more important than hand anthropometry that influenced different throw
tests results in young handball and basketball players.

23534908	Superior reaction to changing directions for skilled basketball defenders but not	"The purpose of the present study was to examine the timing for the detection of relevant information in the final running direction of attackers' cutting
manoeuvres. Skilled basketball players and novices performed sidestep and reach
tasks in response to a ready-go choice stimuli using light-emitting diode (LED) task
and video stimuli (video task) wherein skilled ball players executed cutting
manoeuvres. The time at which the defenders first obtained relevant visual
information was estimated by subtracting the visuo-motor processing time, acquired
from the reaction time in the LED task, from the reaction time in the video task.
Skilled basketball players reacted to and reached towards the target faster than
novices, whereas the estimated video cue timings for the skilled players were not
different from those for the novices. The results suggest that the anticipation of
attacker's direction in this task would be a general visuo-motor skill, even without
previous specialised perceptual training. Combined with the results from the
reaction performance in the video task, we conclude that novices are afforded
shorter times and more uncertain information before their stepping when they are in
a one-on-one ballgame defensive scenario because their sidestepping takes a
relatively long time.

15722283	Anterior cruciate ligament injury in national collegiate athletic association	"BACKGROUND: Female collegiate athletes have been reported to have a higher rate of anterior cruciate ligament injury compared to male collegiate athletes. This finding
has spawned a branch of research focused on understanding and preventing this injury
pattern. PURPOSE: To determine if the trends reported in 1994 have continued. STUDY
TYPE: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: The National Collegiate Athletic
Association Injury Surveillance System database was reviewed for all data relating
to men's and women's basketball and soccer anterior cruciate ligament injuries for
1990 to 2002. RESULTS: No significant difference was seen in basketball comparing
frequency of contact versus noncontact injuries between men (70.1%) and women
(75.7%). Male basketball players sustained 37 contact injuries and 78 noncontact
injuries. Female basketball players sustained 100 contact injuries and 305
noncontact injuries. In soccer, there was a significant difference in frequency of
injury for male (49.6%) and female (58.3%) athletes when comparing contact and
noncontact injuries (chi2=4.1, P<.05). Male soccer players sustained 72 contact
injuries and 66 noncontact injuries. Female soccer players sustained 115 contact
injuries and 161 noncontact injuries. The magnitude of the difference in injury
rates between male and female basketball players (0.32-0.21, P=.93) remained
constant, whereas the magnitude of the difference in the rate of injuries between
male and female soccer players (0.16-0.21, P=.08) widened. Comparing injury within
gender by sport, soccer players consistently sustained more anterior cruciate
ligament injuries than did basketball players. The rate of anterior cruciate
ligament injury for male soccer players was 0.11 compared to 0.08 for male
basketball players (P=.002). The rate of anterior cruciate ligament injury for
female soccer players was 0.33 and for female basketball players was 0.29 (P=.04).
The rates for all anterior cruciate ligament injuries for women were statistically
significantly higher (P<.01) than the rates for all anterior cruciate ligament
injuries for men, regardless of the sport. In soccer, the rate of all anterior
cruciate ligament injuries across the 13 years for male soccer players significantly
decreased (P=.02), whereas it remained constant for female players. CONCLUSIONS: In
this sample, the rate of anterior cruciate ligament injury, regardless of mechanism
of injury, continues to be significantly higher for female collegiate athletes than
for male collegiate athletes in both soccer and basketball. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
Despite vast attention to the discrepancy between anterior cruciate ligament injury
rates between men and women, these differences continue to exist in collegiate
basketball and soccer players. Also demonstrated is that although the rate of injury
for women is higher than for men, the actual rate of injury remains low and should
not be a deterrent to participation in sports.

27868427	Influence of shoe midsole hardness on plantar pressure distribution in four	"This study examined how shoe midsole hardness influenced plantar pressure in basketball-related movements. Twenty male university basketball players wore
customized shoes with hard and soft midsoles (60 and 50 Shore C) to perform four
movements: running, maximal forward sprinting, maximal 45° cutting and lay-up.
Plantar loading was recorded using an in-shoe pressure measuring system, with peak
pressure (PP) and pressure time integral (PTI) extracted from 10 plantar regions.
Compared with hard shoes, subjects exhibited lower PP in one or more plantar regions
when wearing the soft shoes across all tested movements (Ps < 0.05). Lower PTI was
also observed in the hallux for 45° cutting, and the toes and forefoot regions
during the first step of lay-up in the soft shoe condition (Ps < 0.05). In
conclusion, using a softer midsole in the forefoot region may be a plausible remedy
to reduce the high plantar loading experienced by basketball players.

26595202	A BALANCED TEAM WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS: 66 YEARS OF DATA FROM THE NATIONAL BASKETBALL	"Explicitly monitoring one's own actions has been noted as detrimental to the performance of fine motor skills under duress. Offensive skills rather than
defensive skills are typically studied in this context. Defensive techniques
typically require skills such as footwork and continuous movement, as opposed to
more precise, hand-eye coordinated action. Explicit monitoring theory may be less
relevant for defensive skills than offensive skills when playing under pressure.
Archival data (66 years) for teams and for individual players was compiled from the
National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Football League (NFL). For
basketball (n=778) and football (n=515) teams, regular season offensive and
defensive statistics similarly predicted success in the postseason, which was
assumed to create more pressure. For individual basketball players (n=5,132), nine
indices of offensive (FG, free throw and three-point shooting, offensive win shares,
points, and assists) and defensive (defensive win shares, steals, and blocks)
production were compared; among these, three-point shooting percentage was least
correlated from season to postseason, suggesting it is especially variable under
pressure. A balanced basketball or football team that focuses on both offense and

26208533	Effect of different number of players and training regimes on physiological and	"This study aimed to analyse the effects of two factors (number of players and training regimes) on players' physiological and technical demands in basketball
ball-drills. Twenty-one young basketball players performed four different
ball-drills (two levels for each factor). The number of players involved was 2vs2
and 4vs4, while ball-drill regimes were continuous and intermittent. Physiological
demand was assessed using the percentage of maximal heart rate (%HRmax), Edwards'
training load and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Furthermore, the following
technical actions were collected: dribbles, steals, rebounds, turnovers, passes
(total, correct, wrong and % of correct pass) and shots (total, scored, missed and %
of made shot). A 2 × 2 (number of players × regime) two-way ANOVA with repeated
measures was applied for physiological parameters and technical actions. The 2vs2
condition showed higher %HRmax (P < 0.001), Edwards' training load (P < 0.001), RPE
(P < 0.001), number of dribbles (P < 0.001), rebounds (P < 0.001), passes [total
(P = 0.005) and correct (P = 0.005)] and shots [total (P < 0.001) scored (P < 0.001)
and missed (P < 0.001)] than 4vs4. Moreover, the continuous regime revealed higher
%HRmax (P < 0.001), Edwards' training load (P < 0.001), RPE (P = 0.006) and dribbles
(P < 0.001) than the intermittent regime. This study showed that both number of
players and regime are useful variables able to modify basketball ball-drills
workload.

23215863	Motor adaptation in complex sports - the influence of visual context information on	"We examined the influence of visual context information on skilled motor behaviour and motor adaptation in basketball. The rules of basketball in Europe have recently
changed, such that that the distance for three-point shots increased from 6.25 m to
6.75 m. As such, we tested the extent to which basketball experts can adapt to the
longer distance when a) only the unfamiliar, new three-point line was provided as
floor markings (NL group), or b) the familiar, old three-point line was provided in
addition to the new floor markings (OL group). In the present study 20 expert
basketball players performed 40 three-point shots from 6.25 m and 40 shots from 6.75
m. We assessed the percentage of hits and analysed the landing position of the ball.
Results showed better adaptation of throwing performance to the longer distance when
the old three-point line was provided as a visual landmark, compared to when only
the new three-point line was provided. We hypothesise that the three-point line
delivered relevant information needed to successfully adapt to the greater distance
in the OL group, whereas it disturbed performance and ability to adapt in the NL
group. The importance of visual landmarks on motor adaptation in basketball throwing
is discussed relative to the influence of other information sources (i.e. angle of
elevation relative to the basket) and sport practice.

22402277	Movement pattern recognition in basketball free-throw shooting.	"The purpose of the present study was to analyze the movement patterns of free-throw shooters in basketball at different skill levels. There were two points of interest.
First, to explore what information can be drawn from the movement pattern and
second, to examine the methodological possibilities of pattern analysis. To this
end, several qualitative and quantitative methods were employed. The resulting data
were converged in a triangulation. Using a special kind of ANN named Dynamically
Controlled Networks (DyCoN), a 'complex feature' consisting of several isolated
features (angle displacements and velocities of the articulations of the kinematic
chain) was calculated. This 'complex feature' was displayed by a trajectory
combining several neurons of the network, reflecting the devolution of the twelve
angle measures over the time course of each shooting action. In further network
analyses individual characteristics were detected, as well as movement phases.
Throwing patterns were successfully classified and the stability and variability of
the realized pattern were established. The movement patterns found were clearly
individually shaped as well as formed by the skill level. The triangulation
confirmed the individual movement organizations. Finally, a high stability of the
network methods was documented.

18949920	[Sports injuries of temporomandibular joints and oral muscles in basketball	"All sporting activities have an associated risk of orofacial injuries due to falls, collisions with players, devices, and hard surfaces. Many authors have reported
about incidence of orofacial injuries during sports activities. Flanders and Bhat
concluded that 34% of all injuries in basketball are orofacial injuries, while
orofacial injuries account for only 0.07% of all injuries in American football. AIM,
METHODS AND EXAMINEES: The aim of this investigation was to identify the incidence,
type and severity of temporomandibular joint injuries, stiffness and pain in oral
muscles, and pain during opening and closure of the mouth while playing basketball.
The sample consisted of 195 basketball players, 135 professionals and 60
non-professionals. They filled out the questionnaire individually with help of the
researchers. RESULTS: The data received by the survey revealed a total of 350
temporomandibular joint injuries and/or pain, oral muscles stiffness and pain during
opening and closure of the mouth during basketball career. The incidence of injuries
was higher in professional 72.6% (254) than in non-professional players 27.4% (96).
Twenty-four professional and 9 non-professional players reported pain or oral
muscles stiffness, while 58 professional and 15 non-professional players reported
pain during opening and closing the mouth. Only 1 non-professional player and 6
professional players reported injuries of the temporomandibular joint. All
basketball players who were injured during their career had more than one injury.
During career, professional players reported pain while opening and closing of the
mouth more often than non-professional players, on the average 1.3 and 0.9 times,
respectively. Pain or oral muscles stiffness during basketball career was reported
0.6 times on the average by non-professional players, as compared to 0.5 times by
professional players. Non-professional players reported 5.2% injuries of
temporomandibular joints during their career, while professional players only 3.2%.
With regard to positions in the team, most injuries of temporomandibular joints,
stiffness and pain in oral muscles were reported by forwards, on the average 2.33
incidents. Centers were the second most frequently injured group with an average of
1.96 incidents, followed by point guards with 1.74, power forwards with 1.62 and
guards with 1.55 incidents. CONCLUSION: Only 2 basketball players (1%) frequently
used a mouthguard and 93.3% of them never even tried to wear a mouthguard.
Implementation of mandatory mouthguard usage in sports, such as basketball, would
decrease such a large number of sports injuries. Mouthguards would absorb the force
of impact and consequently stiffness and pain in oral muscles so that injuries of
temporomandibular joints would be reduced or even avoided. Such a low percentage of
mouthguard use in basketball players reflects poor awareness and education of both
athletes and coaches, as well as an insufficient role of dentists in sports medicine
and education.

19620905	Lower limb maximal dynamic strength and agility determinants in elite basketball	"The aims of this study were to examine the relationship between squat 1 repetition maximum (1RM) and basketball-relevant tests and the variables that influence agility
(T-test) in elite male professional basketball players (n = 14, age 23.3 +/- 2.7
years, height 195.6 +/- 8.3 cm, body mass 94.2 +/- 10.2 kg). T-test performance was
significantly related to body mass (r = 0.58, p = 0.03) and to percentage of body
fat (r = 0.80, p < 0.001). A significant negative correlation was observed between
t-test and 5-jump test performance (r = -0.61, p = 0.02). Squat 1RM was
significantly related to 5-, 10-, and 30-m sprint times. Stepwise correlation
analysis showed percentage of body fat was the best single predictor factor (p <
0.05) of agility. Squat 1RM performance was the best single predictor of 5-m and
10-m sprint times (p < 0.05). In light of the present study's findings, agility
should be regarded as a per se physiological ability for elite basketball players.
Consequently, basketball-specific agility drills should be stressed in elite
basketball training. Given the association between squat 1RM performance and short
sprint times, squat exercises should be a major component of basketball
conditioning.

8775647	Peak torque of quadriceps and hamstring muscles in basketball and soccer players of	"Basketball and soccer are two games with different training and playing procedures. The purpose of this study was to examine the maximal voluntary peak torques of the
quadriceps and hamstring muscles, and the torque ratio between these muscle groups
in basketball players (n = 61) and soccer players (n = 51) participating in teams of
different divisions. Isokinetic peak torques were measured using the Cybex II
isokinetic dynamometer at 60 and 180 degrees.s-1. Basketball players of the national
team produced higher peak torque values of quadriceps muscles than the other
basketball players of different divisions (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). Hamstring peak
torques of the national basketball team were significantly higher the only
velocities measured compared with the players from division II and IV (p < 0.05).
Peak torque values of quadriceps muscles relative to body weight were significantly
higher in the national basketball team compared with basketball players from
division I. No significant differences were found in peak torque values of
quadriceps and hamstring muscles within the different basketball and soccer
divisions. Peak torque expressed in absolute terms was significantly higher in
basketball players than in soccer players (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). However, these
differences were not significant when the strength of quadriceps and hamstring
muscles was expressed relative to body weight. The H/Q ratio did not differ either
ditto among the different divisions of basketball and soccer players. Based on the
data obtained in this study, we concluded that the subjects' body weight have a
decisive effect on the production of peak torque values of quadriceps and hamstring
muscles in basketball and soccer players. Furthermore that the playing in different
divisions, as well as participating in different sports, i.e. basketball or soccer,
have surprisingly small effects on the peak isokinetic torque production of the
quadriceps and hamstring muscles.

Ryan's self-determination theory. Secondly to analyse the differences that exist
between them with respect to the socio-demographic variables gender and age. A
sample of 292 federated basketball players from the Region of Murcia (Spain) with
ages between 14 and 18 years old was used. In addition, Castilian versions of The
Perception of Success Questionnaire (POSQ) and the Sports Motivational Scale (SMS)
were administered. Three statistical analyses were employed, a descriptive analysis,
a correlation analysis and a regression analysis. The results showed a positive
relation between ego orientation, extrinsic motivation and amotivation. The
motivational relations between both theories and the differences with respect to
gender and age are discussed. We have found out that mainly gender and also age
differences are strong predictors of ego orientation, extrinsic motivation of
external regulation and amotivation. We can also confirm that extrinsic motivation
of external regulation positively predicts ego orientation and a decrease of task
orientation. The results ratify the use of the Spanish version of the SMS to measure
different types of motivation within the sports context.

16000667	Ankle joint proprioception and postural control in basketball players with bilateral	"BACKGROUND: Deficiencies in ankle proprioception and standing balance in basketball players with multiple ankle sprains have been reported in separate studies. However,
the question of how ankle proprioceptive inputs and postural control in stance are
related is still unclear. HYPOTHESIS: Ankle repositioning errors and the amount of
postural sway in stance are increased in basketball players with multiple ankle
sprains. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Twenty healthy male
basketball players and 19 male basketball players who had suffered bilateral ankle
sprains within the past 2 years were examined. Both groups were similar in age.
Passive ankle joint repositioning errors at 5 degrees of plantar flexion were used
to test for ankle joint proprioception. The Sensory Organization Test was applied
with dynamic posturography to assess postural sway angle under 6 sensory conditions.
RESULTS: A significant increase in ankle repositioning errors was demonstrated in
basketball players with bilateral ankle sprains (P < .05). The mean errors in the
right and left ankles were increased from 1.0 degrees (standard deviation, 0.4
degrees ) and 0.8 degrees (standard deviation, 0.2 degrees ), respectively, in the
healthy players to 1.4 degrees (standard deviation, 0.7 degrees ) and 1.1 degrees
(standard deviation, 0.5 degrees ) in the injured group. A significant increase in
the amount of postural sway in the injured subjects was also found in conditions 1,
2, and 5 of the Sensory Organization Test (P < .05). Furthermore, there were
positive associations between averaged errors in repositioning both ankles and
postural sway angles in conditions 1, 2, and 3 of the Sensory Organization Test (r =
0.39-0.54, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Ankle repositioning errors and postural sway in
stance increased in basketball players with multiple ankle sprains. A positive
relationship was found between these 2 variables. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Such findings
highlight the need for the rehabilitation of patients with multiple ankle sprains to
include proprioceptive and balance training.

26654988	THE HOME ADVANTAGE IN MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL.	"Home advantage is smaller in baseball than in other major professional sports for men, specifically football, basketball, or soccer. This paper advances an
explanation. It begins by reviewing the main observations to support the view that
there is little or no home advantage in individual sports. It then presents the case
that home advantage originates in impaired teamwork among the away players. The need
for teamwork and the extent of it vary from sport to sport. To the extent that a
sport requires little teamwork it is more like an individual sport, and the home
team would be expected to enjoy only a small advantage. Interactions among players
on the same side (teamwork) are much less common in baseball than in the other
sports considered.

25474443	"""Hand down, man down."" Analysis of defensive adjustments in response to the hot hand"	"The hot-hand phenomenon, according to which a player's performance is significantly elevated during certain phases relative to the expected performance based on the
player's base rate, has left many researchers and fans in basketball puzzled: The
vast majority of players, coaches and fans believe in its existence but statistical
evidence supporting this belief has been scarce. It has frequently been argued that
the hot hand in basketball is unobservable because of strategic adjustments and
defensive interference of the opposing team. We use a dataset with novel metrics,
such as the number of defenders and the defensive intensity for each shot attempt,
which enable us to directly measure defensive pressure. First, we examine how the
shooting percentage of NBA players changes relative to the attributes of each
metric. We find that it is of lesser importance by how many defenders a player is
guarded but that defensive intensity, e.g., whether a defender raises his hand when
his opponent shoots, has a larger impact on shot difficulty. Second, we explore how
the underlying metrics and shooting accuracy change as a function of streak length.
Our results indicate that defensive pressure and shot difficulty increase (decrease)
during hot (cold) streaks, so that defenders seem to behave according to the
hot-hand belief and try to force hot players into more difficult shots. However, we
find that shooting percentages of presumably hot players do not increase and that
shooting performance is not related to streakiness, so that the defenders' hot-hand
behavior cannot be considered ecologically rational. Therefore, we are unable to
find evidence in favor of the hot-hand effect even when accounting for defensive
pressure.

study is to examine basketball-related injuries among adults presenting to
ambulatory settings in the United States. DESIGN: Retrospective review of medical
records. SETTING: Emergency departments, outpatient departments, and physicians'
offices in the United States. PATIENTS: Nationally representative sample of adults
presenting to ambulatory care settings in the United States for treatment of
injuries incurred while playing basketball. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Body site
injured, type of injury, ambulatory treatment site, and utilization of diagnostic
testing. RESULTS: An annual average of 507,000 adults were treated in an ambulatory
care setting for injuries related to playing basketball. The majority of these
patients sought treatment in physicians' offices. Females had a much lower rate of
visits (0.8/1000) for basketball-related injuries than males (5.7/1000); African
American males had a rate 2.7 times higher than white males. The most common
injuries were sprains and strains to the lower leg and/or ankle region and fractures
of the hand, wrist, or fingers. Specific analyses of patients presenting to the
emergency department diagnosed with sprain/strain injuries to the lower leg/ankle
region revealed that 93% of these patients received an x-ray procedure. CONCLUSIONS:
Basketball injuries constitute a significant portion of ambulatory medical care use
in the United States each year, particularly among young adult males and African
American males. Better surveillance of adult participation in sports and
recreational activities is needed to better identify risk and protective factors for
injuries.

15320655	Intense basketball-simulated exercise induces muscle damage in men with elevated	"The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the levels of muscle soreness, muscle damage, and performance output in men with (S, n = 24) or without
(A, n = 24) chronic compartment syndrome (CACS)-related symptoms after an intense
10-minute basketball-simulated exercise. Anterior compartment pressure (ICP), muscle
soreness perception, creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
activities, myoglobin (Mb) concentration, leg strength, and knee joint range of
motion (KJRM) were measured at rest, immediately after exercise, and at 24, 48, 72
and 96 hours postexercise (ICP was also measured at 5, 15, and 30 minutes
postexercise). ICP, muscle soreness, CK, LDH, and myoglobin increased (p < 0.05)
immediately postexercise and during the next 4 days of recovery in both groups.
However, S demonstrated a far more pronounced and prolonged (p < 0.05) response than
A. Leg strength and KJRM declined (p < 0.05) in both groups, but S demonstrated a
greater (p < 0.05) performance deterioration than A. The results of this study
suggest that intense basketball-simulated exercise increases ICP, muscle soreness,
and indices of muscle damage with a concomitant decrease of performance. Men with
CACS-related symptoms and/or history appear more sensitive to muscle damage and
soreness than asymptomatic men, probably due to a compromised blood flow to the
muscle producing fluid shifts from vascular to interstitial space and further
increasing compartment pressure and muscle cell disruption. Results of the present
investigation provide evidence to support proper diagnosis, monitoring, care, and
preventive measures for symptomatic individuals prior to participation in activities
such as basketball.

26391156	Mouthguard BITES (behavior, impulsivity, theory evaluation study): what drives	"Although mouthguards are effective, inexpensive, easy to use, and readily available, this form of protective equipment has been underutilized. ""Impulsive delay
discounting"" (an index of impulsive behavior) among high school athletes may help
explain their decision making regarding use of protective equipment such as
mouthguards. We investigated the relationship between high school baseball,
softball, and basketball players' mouthguard use, impulsive delay discounting, and
the precaution adoption process model (a behavior change theory). A convenience
sample of boys' and girls' basketball and baseball/softball players at 21 high
schools in the Greater Columbus, Ohio, metro area completed a self-administered
survey that captured their demographic information, knowledge, attitudes, and
beliefs regarding mouthguard use, impulsive delay discounting, and precaution
adoption process model stage. We surveyed a total of 1636 students (55.9 % male,
43.8 % female, 0.3 % unknown). Only 12.3 % reported using a mouthguard either every
time or sometimes during practice or competition. The primary reasons reported for
not wearing mouthguards were they were not required to (65.3 %) and that the
athletes could not breathe or talk while wearing one (61.5 %). These reasons were
consistent across sex and sport. Most athletes reported that their coaches (87.3 %)
and parents (64.5 %) had never talked to them about wearing a mouthguard. Lower
precaution adoption process model stage was significantly associated with higher
impulsivity (p < 0.001) and higher delayed discounting (p = 0.016) after adjusting
for school, sport, and sex. Voluntary mouthguard use among high school athletes
playing basketball and baseball/softball remains low despite the risk of dental
injury in these sports. Effective, evidence-based, targeted, and tailored
interventions to improve adolescent athletes' use of mouthguards to prevent
sports-related dental injuries should be based on the specific behavioral and social
factors influencing each athlete's decision making regarding use of mouthguards.

basketball players from nine teams in A-1 Croatian Basketball League and N2 = 116
recreational table tennis players who play in Table Tennis Organization of Clubs and
Actives in Zagreb. Principal Components Analyses at both instruments showed
two-component structures: combined social-task cohesion and friendship were latent
dimensions of perceived group cohesion, while the internalized standards and
externalized standards revealed two aspects of multidimensional perfectionism in
sport situations. In perceived group cohesion, basketball players achieved higher
average results than table tennis players in the friendship, while the table tennis
players showed higher combined social and task orientation than basketball players.
In multidimensional sport perfectionism, basketball players have higher average
result than table tennis players in the dimension of internalized perfectionism, but
in externalized perfectionism there is no statistical significant difference.
Younger players showed higher average results than older players in the dimension of
friendship, while older players showed higher combined social and task orientation
than younger players. Younger players have higher average scores in internalized
perfectionism. The main importance of the research is adjustment of multidimensional
perfectionism in sport situations and perceived group cohesion to Croatian athletes,
providing additional possibility of cross-cultural adjustment of both concepts,

national- and regional-level basketball players performed 3 trials of 4 technical
gestures (free throw, jump stop shot, three-point shot and lay-up) barefoot on a
pressure platform placed in fixed positions on the court. Raw data were processed to
calculate location and magnitude of pressure peaks in three sub-regions (forefoot,
midfoot and rearfoot), and the increase ratio was calculated relative to plantar
pressure measured during a static bipedal and unipedal upright stance. The results
showed significant increases (p<0.001) in plantar pressure peaks in forefoot (but
not midfoot and rearfoot) for all the gestures that involved the use of both legs.
Particularly large increases were detected for the three-point shot. All three
sub-regions underwent significant changes of the pressure peak in the case of lay-up
(forefoot and rearfoot: p<0.001, midfoot: p=0.002). The high levels of contact
stress detected for routinely performed technical gestures suggest that a detailed
knowledge of changes in the physiological patterns of plantar stresses that take
place during play is crucial in reducing the risk of foot injuries and establishing
proper training and rehabilitation protocols.

23156921	Dynamic criteria: a longitudinal analysis of professional basketball players'	"This paper describes the fluctuations of temporal criteria dynamics in the context of professional sport. Specifically, we try to verify the underlying deterministic
patterns in the outcomes of professional basketball players. We use a longitudinal
approach based on the analysis of the outcomes of 94 basketball players over ten
years, covering practically players' entire career development. Time series were
analyzed with techniques derived from nonlinear dynamical systems theory. These
techniques analyze the underlying patterns in outcomes without previous shape
assumptions (linear or nonlinear). These techniques are capable of detecting an
intermediate situation between randomness and determinism, called chaos. So they are
very useful for the study of dynamic criteria in organizations. We have found most
players (88.30%) have a deterministic pattern in their outcomes, and most cases are
chaotic (81.92%). Players with chaotic patterns have higher outcomes than players
with linear patterns. Moreover, players with power forward and center positions
achieve better results than other players. The high number of chaotic patterns found
suggests caution when appraising individual outcomes, when coaches try to find the
appropriate combination of players to design a competitive team, and other personnel
decisions. Management efforts must be made to assume this uncertainty.

17574917	The Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test in basketball players.	"The purpose of this study was to examine the physiological correlates of the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) in basketball players. Twenty-two
male basketball players (means+/-S.D., body mass 72.4+/-11.4kg, height
181.7+/-6.9cm, age 16.8+/-2.0 years) were tested for maximal oxygen uptake
(VO(2max)), ventilatory threshold (VT) and running economy (RE) on a motorized
treadmill. Lower limb explosive strength and anaerobic-capacity was assessed using
vertical jumps (CMJ), 15m shuttle running sprint (15mSR) and line drill (LD),
respectively. The same test battery was replicated after an experimental basketball
game in order to assess selective effect of fatigue on physical performance. Pre to
post-game CMJ (40.3+/-5.7 versus 39.9+/-5.9cm) and 15mSR (5.80+/-0.25 versus
5.77+/-0.22s) performances were not significantly different (p>0.05). LD performance
decreased significantly post-game (from 26.7+/-1.3 to 27.7+/-2.7s, p<0.001). Yo-Yo
IR1 performances (m) were significantly related to VO(2max) (r=0.77, p=0.0001),
speed at VO(2max) (r=0.71, p=0.0001) and %VO(2max) at VT (r=-0.60, p=0.04). Yo-Yo
IR1 performance was significantly correlated to post-game LD decrements (r=-0.52,
p=0.02). These findings show that Yo-Yo IR1 may be considered as a valid
basketball-specific test for the assessment of aerobic fitness and game-related
endurance.

15895323	Biomechanics and energetics of basketball wheelchairs evolution.	"The aim of this study was to investigate metabolic demand and mechanical work of different basketball wheelchairs that represented significant stages of its
evolution from 1960 to date. Four subjects pushed each model on a basketball court
at different speeds (from 0.90 to 2.35 m.s(-1)). During the trials, oxygen
consumption was measured. Also, the different forms of mechanical work involved in
the exercise were investigated. The oxygen consumption decreased from the oldest
model to the next ones, remaining then quite constant. This was also the same with
breathing and pushing frequencies. Both the work against air drag and rolling
resistance decreased, air drag always played a minor role due to the low speeds
investigated. The total mechanical work was highest in the oldest wheelchair and
lowest in the newest one. The efficiencies were found similar for all the chairs but
the most recent one (less efficient). Already by the 1970's the wheelchair economy
had reached an acceptable level, at least partially because of its improved
ergonomics. Yet, when focusing on the efficiency, the surprisingly low value with
the newest model suggests factors other than the economy (need of better balance,
responsiveness, and ground grip) as determinants of the evolution of this device.

24918314	"""I'm pretty sure that we will win!"": The influence of score-related nonverbal"	"The goal of the present research was to test whether score-related changes in opponents' nonverbal behavior influence athletes' confidence in beating their
opponents. In an experiment, 40 participants who were experienced basketball players
watched brief video clips depicting athletes' nonverbal behavior. Video clips were
not artificially created, but showed naturally occurring behavior. Participants
indicated how confident they were in beating the presented athletes in a
hypothetical scenario. Results indicated that participants' confidence estimations
were influenced by opponents' score-related nonverbal behavior. Participants were
less confident about beating a leading team and more confident about beating a
trailing team, although they were unaware of the actual score during the depicted
scenes. The present research is the first to show that in-game variations of
naturally occurring nonverbal behavior can influence athletes' confidence. This
finding highlights the importance of research into nonverbal behavior in sports,
particularly in relation to athletes' confidence.

22289698	Monitoring internal load parameters during simulated and official basketball	"The purpose of this study was to compare the internal load responses (session rating of perceived exertion [RPE] and salivary cortisol) between simulated and official
matches (SM and OM). Ten professional basketball players participated in 2 OMs and 2
SMs during the competition season. Subjects provided saliva samples 30 minutes
before the prematch warm-up (PRE) and 10 minutes after the end of the match. Session
RPE (CR-10 scale) was assessed 30 minutes after each match. The results from the
2-way analysis of variance showed significant differences for post-OM salivary
cortisol as compared with pre-OM values (p < 0.05). No changes were observed for
cortisol during the SM. Before the OM, a significant difference in salivary cortisol
was observed as compared with pre-SM values (p < 0.05). Moreover, the OM session RPE
was significantly greater than that of SM. There was a significant correlation
between session RPE and cortisol changes (r = 0.75). In summary, the results of this
study showed a greater magnitude of cortisol and session RPE responses after OM as
compared with that after SM confirming the hypothesis that a real competition
generates a greater stress response than a simulated condition does. The
anticipatory effect was also observed in the OM. In addition, the results indicate
that session RPE seems to be a viable tool in monitoring internal loads, and the
results are useful in providing a better understanding of internal loads imposed by
basketball training and competitions. The precise monitoring of these responses
might help the coaches to plan appropriate loads maximizing recovery and
performance.

20634745	Contributions of selected fundamental factors to basketball performance in adult	"The purpose of this study was to determine the contributions of selected fundamental factors to basketball performance in adult players with mental retardation (MR).
Fourteen trained male players with MR (32.1 +/- 7.4 years) were recruited. The
athletes' performances were assessed using adapted basketball tests that assessed 4
ability levels of increasing difficulty (from I to IV), each one characterized by
the analysis of 4 fundamental areas: ball handling, reception, passing, and
shooting. The fundamental factors included anthropometric measurements (height,
weight, and body mass index), static balance, muscular strength and endurance,
explosive leg power, cardiovascular endurance, and motor coordination. This study
showed that greater explosive leg power and upper-body muscular strength and
endurance had significant contributions to ball handling (85%, p < 0.01), and
explosive leg power had significant positive contribution in reception (59%, p <
0.05) and shooting (64%, p = 0.01). The forearm muscular strength and upper-body
muscular strength and endurance had significant contributions to passing (78%, p =
0.01). Moreover, the greater explosive leg power had significant contribution in
level II (46%, p < 0.05), in level III (52%, p < 0.05), and in global score (60%, p
< 0.05). In conclusion, the results showed the possibility to determine the
contribution of selected fundamental factors to basketball performance. Therefore,
the basketball coach could improve a selected fundamental factor to increase
specific basketball ability. This should be addressed in a specific training to help
players with MR to perform successfully in their competitions.

24129991	Small-sided game training improves aerobic capacity and technical skills in	"The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 2 training interventions based on small-sided games (SGG) and high-intensity interval training (HIT) on physical
and technical performance of male junior basketball players. A secondary objective
was to investigate if these effects were similar in starting and bench players. 18
players participated in a pre-testing session, 6-weeks intervention period and a
post-testing session. Pre- and post-sessions involved assessments of aerobic
fitness, repeated sprint ability (RSA), defensive and offensive agility, upper and
lower body power, shooting and passing skills. Mixed-design analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Bonferroni corrected pairwise comparisons examined the effects of time
and type of intervention on physical and technical performances. The main results
showed that both interventions resulted in similar improvements in aerobic capacity
(+3.4% vs. +4.1%), with greater improvements in bench players compared to starting
players (+7.1% vs. +1.1%, P<0.05). However, RSA was unchanged after both
interventions. In addition, compared to HIT, SSG resulted in greater improvements in
defensive agility (+4.5% vs. -2.7%, P<0.05), shooting skills (+7.4% vs. -2.4%,
P<0.05) and upper body power (+7.9% vs. -2.0%, P<0.05). These results suggest that
SSG should be prioritized in physical conditioning of junior basketball players
during the season. However, when RSA is targeted, more specific training seems
necessary.

athletic development. 750 basketball players aged between 12 and 16 years served as
participants, grouped by sex and competitive level. The Skilled group comprised
players representing the 9 highly ranked regional teams (n=378) while the
Less-skilled group comprised the players representing the remaining 9 regional teams
(n=372). All the participants filled out a previously validated questionnaire based
on retrospective information linked to the training activities experienced
throughout their involvement in sport. Results suggest that the majority of the
players started practicing sports preferentially between 6 and 10 years. However, a
significant number of players reported a later start, between 11 and 14 years of
age. The pattern of sport involvement confirmed important divergences in the path
reported by the players by the team's competitive level. The major findings of this
study confirmed that players representing the highly ranked teams demonstrated a
tendency to extend their training activities during longer periods during the week

24495052	Trait compensation and sex-specific aging of performance in male and female	"Phenotypic traits are often influenced by dynamic resource allocation trade-offs which, when occurring over the course of individual lifespan, may manifest as trait
aging. Although aging is studied for a variety of traits that are closely tied to
reproduction or reproductive effort, the aging of multiple traits related to fitness
in other ways are less well understood. We took advantage of almost 30 years of data
on human whole-organism performance in the National Basketball Association (USA) to
examine trends of aging in performance traits associated with scoring. Given that
patterns of aging differ between sexes in other animal species, we also analyzed a
smaller dataset on players in the Women's National Basketball Association to test
for potential sex differences in the aging of comparable traits. We tested the
hypothesis that age-related changes in a specific aspect of overall performance can
be compensated for by elevated expression of another, related aspect. Our analyses
suggest that the aging of performance traits used in basketball is generally
characterized by senescence in males, whereas age-related changes in basketball
performance are less evident in females. Our data also indicate a different rate of
senescence of different performance traits associated with scoring over a male's
lifetime.

8809716	The relationship between basketball shooting kinematics, distance and playing	"Three-dimensional cinematography (100 Hz) was used to establish the relationship between distance and the kinematics of shooting with respect to playing position in
basketball. Fifteen subjects, divided into guards, forwards and centres (all n = 5),
performed jump shots from each of three distances: 2.74, 4.57 and 6.40 m from the
basket. Increases in mean release speed were found as shooting distance increased
for all groups. This was due to increased angular velocities of both shoulder
flexion and elbow extension and an increased speed of the centre of mass in the
direction of the basket. Release angles for the two shorter distances (52-55
degrees) tended to provide the advantage of a steep angle of entry into the basket,
whereas those at the longest distance (48-50 degrees) were closer to those requiring
the minimum possible release speed. All groups exhibited an earlier timing of
release as shooting distance increased, which gave rise to an earlier rotation of
the shoulder axis. The more consistent changes in kinematic patterns with changes in
shooting distance exhibited by guards as compared to centres would suggest that such
adjustments are easier to make for those players who regularly shoot from long
range.

approach coping styles among Turkish basketball referees. The sample consisted of
125 Turkish basketball referees ranging in age from 18 to 36 years (mean = 25.58. σ
= 3.69). The path analysis tested the relationships simultaneously from stressors,
in consecutive order, distractions, subpar performance and verbal abuse, to coping
styles, first both avoidance-cognitive and approach-cognitive, and then
approach-behaviour. Results indicated that the model achieved a good fit and that
all paths tested simultaneously were significant. The distractions stressor was
positively related to subpar performance, which, in turn, was positively related to
verbal abuse. Verbal abuse was negatively associated with an avoidance-cognitive
coping style and positively related to the approach-cognitive coping style. The
results also supported a crossover effect of both avoidance-cognitive and
approach-cognitive on approach-behaviour. One implication of this study is that
coping should be studied in naturally occurring stages, a process-oriented approach.
Another implication is that approach and avoidance coping styles, each sub-divided
into cognitive and behavioural categories, provide a meaningful framework which
provides sports officials a coherent structure for learning and improving ways to
cope with acute stress experienced during the contest.

26355913	Sustained Improvements in Dynamic Balance and Landing Mechanics After a 6-Week	"CONTEXT: Epidemiological data demonstrate the need for lower-extremity injury-prevention training. Neuromuscular-control (NMC) programs are immediately
effective at minimizing lower-extremity injury risk and improving sport-related
performance measures. Research investigating lasting effects after an
injury-prevention program is limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dynamic
balance, landing mechanics, and hamstring and quadriceps strength could be improved
after a 6-wk NMC intervention and maintained for a season. DESIGN: Prospective case
series. SETTING: Controlled laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: 11 Division I women's
basketball players (age 19.40 ± 1.35 y, height 178.05 ± 7.52 cm, mass 72.86 ± 10.70
kg). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects underwent testing 3 times, completing the Star
Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), Landing Error Scoring System (LESS), and isometric
strength testing for the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles. Pretest and posttest 1
occurred immediately before and after the intervention, respectively, and posttest 2
at the end of the competitive season, 9 mo after posttest 1. Subjects participated
in eighteen 30-min plyometric and NMC-training sessions over a 6-wk period. MAIN
OUTCOME MEASURES: The normalized SEBT composite score, normalized peak isometric
hamstrings:quadriceps (H:Q) ratio, and the LESS total score. RESULTS: The mean
composite reach significantly improved over time (F2,10 = 6.96, P = .005) where both
posttest scores were significantly higher than pretest (70.41% ± 4.08%) (posttest 1
73.48% ± 4.19%, t10 = -3.11, P = .011) and posttest 2 (74.2% ± 4.77%, t10 = -3.78, P
= .004). LESS scores significantly improved over time (F2,10 = 6.29, P = .009). The
pretest LESS score (7.30 ± 3.40) was higher than posttest 1 (4.9 ± 1.20, t10 = 2.71,
P = .024) and posttest 2 (5.44 ± 1.83, t10 = 2.58, P = .030). There were no
statistically significant differences (P > .05) over time for the H:Q ratio when
averaging both legs (F2,10 = 0.83, P = .45). CONCLUSIONS: A 6-wk NMC program
improved landing mechanics and dynamic balance over a 9-mo period in women's
basketball players. NMC adaptations can be retained without an in-season maintenance
program.

over 3 groups, elite (n = 46), subelite (n = 42) junior basketball players, and
nonathletic healthy male athletes (n = 31), were evaluated over a 5-week period. The
participants undertook 2 familiarization trials of the Yo-Yo test performance and 3
test sessions on an indoor basketball court. When controlling for the effect of the
participants' body mass, the results showed that elite athletes had a significantly
higher Yo-Yo performance compared with the subelite athletes (1,271 ± 385 vs. 861 ±
428 m; p < 0.0017; effect size [ES] 1.0 ± 0.35) and the nonathletic group (1,271 ±

0.0017; ES from 0.02 to 0.39) were noted between participants' performance levels
across age groups. Typical between-performance levels and -age groups differences in
the Yo-Yo IR1 were observed. However, when controlling for the effect of the
participants' body mass, this study demonstrates that the Yo-Yo test is accurate
only to discriminate elite junior basketball players but cannot be used to
differentiate the basketball-specific aerobic performance for age.

22574753	Plasticity of human handedness: decreased one-hand bias and inter-manual performance	"Athletes frequently have to adapt their skills to fast changes of play, often requiring the flexible execution of a particular movement skill with either hand. To
assess the influence of sport-specific expertise and extensive sport training on
human laterality, a video analysis of regular basketball games was performed for
professional, semi-professional, and amateur players to investigate how non-dominant
hand use and proficiency change with increasing expertise. Our results showed that
the right-hand (i.e. dominant hand) bias in basketball players is reduced with
increasing expertise (i.e., competitive level). Accordingly, we found that
professional players use their non-dominant hand more often and with greater success
than semi-professional and amateur players. This was true for most of the
basketball-specific skills. Based on these results, we assume that increasing
amounts of bilateral practice can lead to a shift in task-specific manual preference
towards a higher use of both hands in competition, as well as to a higher
proficiency for non-dominant hand actions in particular. From an applied
perspective, the more frequent use and higher proficiency of the non-dominant hand
in professional basketball players, compared with amateurs, suggests that the
context-specific and skilled use of the non-dominant hand is crucial for successful
play at higher competitive levels in the sport of basketball.

22123556	Assessment of reliability in isokinetic testing among adolescent basketball players.	"BACKGROUND: The reproducibility of day-to-day testing of isokinetic concentric and eccentric muscular actions among adolescent basketball players aged 14 to 16 years
and relationships of mean within-subject variation in two isokinetic testing
sessions with chronological age, biological maturation (estimated age at peak height
velocity), training experience, body size, lower-body morphology, and initial
strength performance were evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample included 27
basketball players who completed replicate test sessions of 5 repetitions of
reciprocal concentric and eccentric knee extensions and flexions at 60º s(-1). A
randomly selected subsample of 8 players completed a third testing session to
confirm reliability estimates. RESULTS: Coefficients of variation (CV) between
sessions 1 and 2 ranged from 8.1% to 17.4%, and intraclass coefficients (ICCs)
ranged from 0.72 to 0.89. For sessions 1 and 3, CVs ranged from 3.9% to 6.0%, and
ICCs ranged from 0.95 to 0.99. The initial level of strength of eccentric knee
flexion (r=-0.43) and eccentric knee extension (r=-0.42) were correlated (P<0.05)
with eccentric knee extension within-variation between two sessions. Training
experience (r=-0.37, P<0.05) and initial values of concentric knee flexion (r=-0.62,
P<0.01) were correlated with concentric knee flexion within-subject differences.
Within-subject variation of eccentric knee extension was correlated (P<0.05) with
chronologic age (r=0.41), estimated age at peak height velocity (r=-0.38), body size
(r=0.41 to 0.47), and leg volume (r=0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Familiarization sessions may
improve the reliability of concentric and eccentric knee isokinetic strength testing
at 60º s(-1) in adolescent basketball players. Age, maturity status, and training
experience of young athletes should be considered when testing knee isokinetic
strength at 60º s(-1).

momentum exists by looking at cases in which a basketball player has three
consecutive free throws. A free throw is a well-defined task executed in a stable
environment, allegedly giving momentum optimal chances to occur. Taking 14 NBA
seasons we collected over 4500 three-free-throw sets (triplets). We obtained the
outcomes of the shots as well as some additional variables about the player and the
game: the player's average free-throw percentage, home or away, and the game score
and the quarter when the free throws were attempted. We first analyse the hit rates
in the three shots and then proceed to regression analysis that also controls for
the abovementioned variables. We address several concerns raised in the literature.
All comparisons and analyses yield the same conclusion that there is no evidence for
momentum in the data.

required participants to dribble as fast as possible in slalom-like movements across
six javelins and return to the initial position. Fifty-two right-handed school
children (M age = 11.7years) practiced this skill in eight sessions over 4 weeks
under one of two training schedules: (a) with the dominant hand, before changing to
their nondominant hand (D-ND group), or (b) with the nondominant hand, before
changing to the dominant hand (ND-D group). All tests were conducted with the right
hand or the left hand only, and a transfer test was given with both hands
alternating. The results of a retention test yielded significantly larger learning
gains for the ND-D group as compared to the D-ND group. It is interesting that this
performance advantage was independent of the respective hand tested. The same
pattern of result was found in the transfer test, with significantly shorter
movement times for the ND-D group with both hands alternating. Such
order-of-practice effects for the acquisition of complex skills can be explained
with hemispheric brain asymmetries for the processing of specific task requirements.

took free throws while wearing mobile eye tracking glasses, before and after
performing a bout of cycling exercise. Shooting accuracy was measured using a
6-point scoring system, and quiet eye duration (the final fixation to a target) was
adopted as an objective measure of top-down attentional control. Four intensities of
exercise (based on an initial ramp test) were performed in a counterbalanced order:
rest, moderate, heavy and severe. The four intensities resulted in participants
reaching 52±4%, 58±4%, 76±6% and 86±5% of their heart rate max, respectively.
Performance and quiet eye were only significantly impaired (19% and 45% drops,
respectively) between pre- and post-intervention at the severe intensity workload
level. Additionally, exercise-induced changes in quiet eye predicted 33% of the
subsequent change in performance accuracy. The results suggest that attentional
disruptions may at least partially explain why sporting skills break down under
acute fatigue. Implications for training to mitigate against these impairments are
discussed.

0.57) or HOPVER (χ = 0.06, P = 0.80). In addition, the 2 performance measures did
not consistently produce the same definition of limb dominance among individuals (χ
= 1.52, P = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Self-selection of the dominant limb is unrelated to
performance. Furthermore, limb dominance, as defined by vertical jump height, is
unrelated to limb dominance defined by horizontal jump distance. The results of this
study call into question the validity of consistently defining limb dominance by
self-reported measures in adolescent female basketball players.

31842134	A 4-Year Profile of Game Demands in Elite Women's Division I College Basketball.	"Ransdell, LB, Murray, T, Gao, Y, Jones, P, and Bycura, D. A 4-year profile of game demands in elite women's Division I college basketball. J Strength Cond Res 34(3):
632-638, 2020-Workload for a Division I women's collegiate basketball team (0.817
win percentage) was examined by: (a) season, (b) player position, and (c) game
outcome (wins vs. losses). Female athletes (n = 6, mean 19.7 ± 1.5 years, at
beginning of study) wore Catapult S5 units during 91.8% of games over a 4-year
period. Average PlayerLoad, PlayerLoad per minute (PL·min), high inertial movement
analysis (high-IMA), and jumps were quantified using Catapult Openfield software
(version 1.14.1+). Data were checked for normality and log- or
square-root-transformed when they were non-normal. A series of linear mixed model
analyses were conducted to detect differences in PlayerLoad, PL·min, high-IMA, and
jumps by season, position, and game outcome. PL·min and jumps data were not normal,
so they were transformed, analyses were run; because there were no differences in
findings, data are reported in original units to allow for comparisons with other
studies. Cohen's d and confidence intervals were provided as additional information
about the strength of reported differences. The 3 most consistent findings were that
across a 4-year period, jumps increased, PL·min was higher in guards compared with
posts, and high-IMA was higher in losses compared with wins. Other workload patterns
were inconsistent, and inappropriate for making conclusive statements. Therefore,
comparing jumps across multiple seasons, PL·min by player position and high-IMA in
losses are important; in addition, all data can be used to profile National
Collegiate Athletic Association Division I women's basketball players and set game
workload expectations.

27636403	Game-specific characteristics of sport-related concussions.	"BACKGROUND: Concussions are common incidences in sports. However, game-specific characteristics such as tactics, field positions, etc. might positively/negatively
contribute to the occurrence of mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) in various
sports such as soccer, volleyball, handball, or basketball. Thus, the intention of
this study was to analyze game-specific characteristics of concussive incidents in
active players from the perspective of different sportive disciplines. METHODS: Four
sport-specific questionnaires for soccer, handball, volleyball and basketball were
established using an online survey tool. RESULTS: A total of 3001 participants
completed the questionnaires. 18% of the participants answered that they had
experienced a concussion which significantly differed depending on the sport
practiced (χ2(3)=56.868, P<0.001; soccer 25%, handball 24%, volleyball 13%,
basketball 15%). Whereas handball and soccer players experienced most concussions on
the amateur level, volleyball players experienced most on the professional level and
basketball players during leisure play (χ2(9)=112.667, P<0.001). Soccer players
experienced most concussions by a collision with another player, volleyball players
instead experienced most concussions by hits from the ball (χ2(6)=211.260, P<0.001).
In soccer, goalkeepers and defensive midfield players showed most concussive
incidences (χ2(7)=19.638, P<0.01); in volleyball, the libero position and outside
positions showed to be significantly affected from sport-related concussions
(χ2(6)=13.617, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present results showed that factors
critically contributing to the occurrence of concussions are sport-specific and
particularly concern amateurs. This indicates that most concussions in ball games
appear in situations, where medical care units are not necessarily present.
Preventive measures should therefore especially address amateurs in ball sports.

17143132	Development of structural cardiac adaptation in basketball players.	"BACKGROUND: As specific features of the basketball player's myocardial structure and function are still rather poorly investigated, we aimed at comparing left
ventricular (LV) echocardiographic indices in players of different age groups.
METHODS: Male basketball players aged 8-13 years (n=31), 14-17 years (n=31) and
18-28 years (n=31) were examined using standard echocardiography. End-diastolic LV
posterior wall thickness and internal diameter, as well as interventricular septum
thickness, were measured by M-mode. Relative wall thickness was calculated by
dividing the sum of the thicknesses of the interventricular septum and LV posterior
wall by LV internal diameter. LV mass and ejection fraction were also calculated.
The morphological LV parameters were corrected for body surface area. The peak early
(E) and peak late (A) transmitral flow velocities were measured using pulsed
Doppler, and the ratio (E/A) was calculated. RESULTS: Significant differences in the
absolute internal LV diameter among the age groups disappeared after allometric
scaling. However, relative wall thickness as well as body size indexed LV posterior
wall thickness and LV mass were significantly greater in the adolescents and adults
than in the children. Players of different age groups did not differ in the E/A
ratio, while ejection fraction was elevated in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Regular
basketball training results in moderate cardiac hypertrophy in adolescents and adult
athletes due to thickening of myocardial walls.

16567461	Comparing the incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injury in collegiate lacrosse,	"BACKGROUND: Female college basketball and soccer athletes have higher rates of anterior cruciate ligament injury than do their male counterparts. Rates of anterior
cruciate ligament injuries for women and men in collegiate lacrosse have not been
examined. Understanding anterior cruciate ligament injury patterns in lacrosse, a
full-contact sport for men and noncontact sport for women, could further injury
prevention efforts. HYPOTHESES: Female anterior cruciate ligament injury rates will
decrease over time owing to longer participation in sports. Lacrosse anterior
cruciate ligament injury rates will be lower than rates in basketball and soccer
possibly owing to beneficial biomechanics of carrying a lacrosse stick. STUDY
DESIGN: Cohort study (Prevalence); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Data from the
National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance System were analyzed to
compare men's and women's anterior cruciate ligament injuries in basketball,
lacrosse, and soccer over 15 years. RESULTS: Anterior cruciate ligament injury rates
in women's basketball and soccer were 0.28 and 0.32 injuries per 1000 athlete
exposures, respectively, and did not decline over the study period. In men's
basketball, injury rate fluctuated between 0.03 and 0.13 athlete exposures. Rates of
anterior cruciate ligament injury did not significantly change in men's soccer over
the study period. The rate of anterior cruciate ligament injury in men's lacrosse
(0.17 athlete exposures, P < .05) was significantly higher than in men's basketball
(0.08 athlete exposures) and soccer (0.12 athlete exposures). Injury rate in women's
lacrosse (0.18 athlete exposures, P < .05) was significantly lower than in women's
basketball and soccer. CONCLUSION: There was no discernable change in rate of
anterior cruciate ligament injury in men or women during the study period. Men's
lacrosse is a high-risk sport for anterior cruciate ligament injury. Unlike
basketball and soccer, the rates of anterior cruciate ligament injury are
essentially the same in men's and women's lacrosse. The level of allowed contact in
pivoting sports may be a factor in determining sport-specific anterior cruciate
ligament risk.

21297570	Anthropometric characteristics and technical skills of 12 and 14 year old basketball	"AIM: The aims of this study were: a) to describe the anthropometric characteristics and technical skills in children aged 12 and 14 taking part in competitive
basketball; b) to compare the mean scores between these two groups; and c) to detect
the relationship between anthropometric characteristics and basketball skills.
METHODS: At the sample of total of 118 young basketball players, 54 of 14 (± 0.5)
year old and 64 of 12 (± 0.5) year old, 18 anthropometric variables were measured:
five longitudinal measures, two transversal measures, body mass, four
circumferences, six skinfolds and 3 derived variables: Body Mass Index (BMI),
sitting height/stature ratio (SH/ST ratio) and sum of skinfolds (SUM SKF). Also,
they did four basketball field tests: speed spot shooting, passing, control dribble
and defensive movement. RESULTS: Values of most of anthropometric variables were
significantly higher in 14 year old players as compared to 12 year old, except in
SH/ST ratio and BMI which were similar. Only values of SUM SKF were significantly
lower in 14 year old players. In variables: control dribble, passing and defensive
movement 14 year old players have better scores then 12 year old players.
CONCLUSION: The players presented a very high values of anthropometric dimensions,
especially longitudinal and a very good technical skills. The correlation between
certain field tests and some anthropometric parameters indicates that some
anthropometric measures might have moderately negative influence on test results in
technical skills in 14 year old players.

22828459	Correlation between explosive strength, aerobic power and repeated sprint ability in	"AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between explosive strength and aerobic power with basketball-specific repeated sprint ability in elite
male basketball players. METHODS: Twenty-four elite basketball players (age 22.2±3.4
years, height 197.1±6.2 cm, weight 95.7±8.8 kg; training experience 11.0±3.1 years;
mean±SD), participated in the study. Subjects performed countermovement jump (CMJ)
test and incremental pseudo-ramp test protocol with measured CMJ height and VO2max,
respectively. Specific repeated sprint ability (RSA) test was conducted, with total
sprinting time (summation of 10 sprint times - RSAtot) and sprint decrement (fatigue
index - RSAFI) calculated. RESULTS: Significant decrements in sprint performance
from the eight 30-m sprint (P<0.05) were observed. Strong inverse correlation was
found between CMJ and RSAtot (r=-0.74, P<0.01). No significant correlation was found
between VO2max and RSA outcomes neither between CMJ and RSAFI. CONCLUSION: CMJ is a
predictor of RSA in elite basketball players. It seems that coaches and strength and
conditioning professionals should devote additional time for explosive strength
development in elite basketball players during preparatory period to enhance RSA
performance.

29384434	The psychomotor vigilance test: a comparison of different test durations in elite	"The 10-min Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT-10) is regarded as the gold-standard for assessing vigilant attention following sleep loss; however, other studies have
investigated whether shorter versions of the test elicit similar results to the
PVT-10. The present study compared the PVT-10 with 3-min (PVT-3) and 5-min (PVT-5)
versions of the test in elite female basketball players. Athletes performed all
three tests in the morning and evening for seven consecutive days. Response speed
(mean reciprocal reaction time; mean 1/RT), number of errors and number of lapses
were determined for each test and time point. The PVT-3 elicited significantly
faster response speeds than the other two tests (p < 0.01), while the PVT-5 and
PVT-10 were not different. The PVT-10 resulted in more lapses than the PVT-5,
followed by the PVT-3, with all tests being significantly different to each other
(p < 0.01). In conclusion, while the PVT-5 and PVT-10 were generally similar for
response speed, the PVT-3 did not produce results comparable with the PVT-10 for
response speed, lapses or errors, and should therefore not be used interchangeably.
Further research is required to determine whether the shorter tests are a suitable
replacement for the PVT-10 in professional basketball players.

25203390	Strategies for defending a dribbler: categorisation of three defensive patterns in	"To clarify the defending-dribbler mechanism, the interaction between the dribbler and defender should be investigated. The purposes of this study were to identify
variables that explain the outcome (i.e. 'penetrating' and 'guarding') and to
understand how defenders stop dribblers by categorising defensive patterns. Ten
basketball players participated as 24 dribbler-defender pairs, who played a
real-time, 1-on-1 sub-phase of the basketball. The trials were categorised into
penetrating trials, where a dribbler invaded the defended area behind the defender,
and guarding trials, where the defender stopped the dribbler's advance. Our results
demonstrated that defenders in guarding trials initiated their movements earlier and
moved quicker than the defenders in penetrating trials. Moreover, linear
discriminant analysis revealed that the differences in initiation time and
medio-lateral peak velocity between the defenders and dribblers were critical
parameters for explaining the difference between penetrating and guarding trials.
Lastly, guarding trials were further categorised into three process patterns during
1-on-1 basketball (i.e. 'early initiation' trials, 'quick movement' trials, and
'dribbler's stop' trials). The results suggest that there are three defending
strategies and that one strategy would be insufficient to explain the
defending-dribbler mechanism, because both players' anticipation and reactive
movement must be considered.

18059995	Ankle sprain injuries: a 2-year prospective cohort study in female Greek	"CONTEXT: Ankle sprains are a common basketball injury. Therefore, examination of risk factors for injury in female professional basketball players is worthwhile.
OBJECTIVE: To examine rates of ankle sprains, associated time missed from
participation, and risk factors for injury during 2 consecutive seasons. DESIGN:
Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Eighteen professional basketball facilities.
PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: We observed 204 players from 18 female professional
basketball teams for 2 consecutive seasons during a 2-year period. MAIN OUTCOME
MEASURE(S): Using questionnaires, we recorded the incidence of ankle sprains,
participation time missed, and mechanisms of injury in games and practice sessions.
Potential risk factors, such as age, body mass, height, training experience, and
history of ankle sprain, were examined using multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Fifty of the 204 participants sustained ankle injuries; injuries included
32 ankle sprains, which translated to an ankle sprain rate of 1.12 per 1000 hours of
exposure to injury. The 32 players missed 224.4 training and game sessions and an
average of 7.01 sessions per injury. Most injuries occurred in the key area of the
basketball court and were the result of contact. Injury rates during games were
higher than injury rates during practice sessions. Centers, followed by guards and
forwards, had the highest rate of injury. Players who did not wear an external ankle
support had an odds ratio of 2.481 for sustaining an ankle sprain. CONCLUSIONS:
Female professional basketball athletes who did not wear an external ankle support,
who played in the key area, or who functioned as centers had a higher risk for ankle
sprain than did other players.

24213739	Drawing disability in Japanese manga: visual politics, embodied masculinity, and	"This work explores disability in the cultural context of contemporary Japanese comics. In contrast to Western comics, Japanese manga have permeated the social
fabric of Japan to the extent that vast numbers of people read manga on a daily
basis. It has, in fact, become such a popular medium for visual communication that
the Japanese government and education systems utilize manga as a social
acculturation and teaching tool. This multibillion dollar industry is incredibly
diverse, and one particularly popular genre is sports manga. However, Inoue
Takehiko's award-winning manga series REAL departs from more conventional sports
manga, which typically focus on able-bodied characters with sometimes exaggerated
superhuman physical abilities, by adopting a more realistic approach to the world of
wheelchair basketball and the people who play it. At the same time REAL explores
cultural attitudes toward disability in Japanese culture-where disability is at
times rendered ""invisible"" either through accessibility problems or lingering
associations of disability and shame. It is therefore extremely significant that
manga, a visual medium, is rendering disability visible-the ultimate movement from
margin to center. REAL devotes considerable attention to realistically illustrating
the lived experiences of its characters both on and off the court. Consequently, the
series not only educates readers about wheelchair basketball but also provides
compelling insight into Japanese cultural notions about masculinity, family,
responsibility, and identity. The basketball players-at first marginalized by their
disability-join together in the unity of a sport typically characterized by its
""abledness.""

cruciate ligament injury in female athletes. This study was conducted to observe the
effect of a foot orthosis on the knee ligament injury rate in female basketball
players at one US university. METHODS: One hundred fifty-five players on the women's
basketball team were observed for knee ligament injury from 1992 to 2005. Athletes
in the 1992-1993 to 1995-1996 school years (July-June) did not receive a foot
orthosis and served as the control group; the treatment group comprised the athletes
during the 1996-1997 to 2004-2005 school years (July-June). Athletes in the
treatment group received a foot orthosis before participating in basketball. Data
analysis included knee ligament injury rates and a comparison of injury rates with
an incidence density ratio. RESULTS: Athletes in the control group had three
collateral ligament injuries and three anterior cruciate ligament injuries, for an
injury rate of 0.50 for both the anterior cruciate ligament and collateral
ligaments. Athletes in the treatment group had four collateral ligament injuries and
one anterior cruciate ligament injury, for an injury rate of 0.29 for the collateral
ligaments and 0.07 for the anterior cruciate ligament. Athletes in the control group
were 1.72 times more likely to sustain a collateral ligament injury and 7.14 times
more likely to sustain an anterior cruciate ligament injury than the treatment
group. CONCLUSIONS: Foot orthoses may contribute to a decreased knee ligament injury
rate in female collegiate basketball players.

this study, four reliability parameters were used to assess the measurement error of
the system: the systematic bias, the inter-observer reliability, the intra-observer
reliability and the absolute reliability. A basketball game video was used for the
analysis. To assess the inter-observer reliability, two observers analysed a
player's covered distance for 50 different periods of the game. To assess the
relative and absolute reliability of the covered distance, the chosen players were
monitored three times by 41 qualified observers. The findings did not indicate a
significant systematic bias in the measurement error using the VMMT1.0 (one-way
ANOVA, P > 0.05). The intra-observer reliability of the monitoring system was rated
as very high (intraclass correlation, ICC = 0.999), similar to its inter-observer
reliability (Pearson product-moment correlation, r = 0.994). The absolute
reliability does not appear to be significant (standard error of measurement, SEM =

16882627	Late information pick-up is preferred in basketball jump shooting.	"In this study we examined the timing of optical information pick-up in basketball jump shooting using an intermittent viewing technique. We expected shooters to
prefer to look at the basket as late as possible under the shooting style used.
Seven experts with a high shooting style and five experts with a low shooting style
took 50 jump shots while wearing liquid-crystal glasses that opened and closed at
pre-set intervals. In principle, under this constraint, the participants could
control when they saw the basket by actively modulating the timing of their
movements. Analyses of the phasing of the movements relative to the events defined
on the glasses revealed that low-style shooters preferred to see the basket just
before the ball passed their line of sight, whereas high-style shooters tended to
view the basket from underneath the ball after it passed their line of sight. Thus,
most shooters preferred to pick up optical information as late as possible given the
adopted shooting style. We conclude that, in dynamic far aiming tasks such as
basketball jump shooting, late pick-up of optical information is critical for the
successful guidance of movements.

somatotypes by position were significantly different (F = 7.73, P < 0.01). Guards
had greater mesomorphy than centres and less ectomorphy than forwards and centres.

ectomorphy, age, height and mass, only height, mass and ectomorphy entered (Wilks'
lambda = 0.351, F = 31.40, P < 0.000), 70% of the variance was accounted for, and
72% of players were correctly classified. In the four top versus four bottom teams,
guards were taller and more ectomorphic, forwards were taller, with lower mesomorphy
and higher ectomorphy, and centres did not differ. Thus there are some differences
in somatotypes by position and team placing, but the combination of height, mass and
ectomorphy provide the best differentiation by position.

2.134 m (7 ft) above the ground. We found that the shooter should place up to 3 Hz
of back spin on the ball, should aim the ball towards the back of the ring, and
should launch the ball at 52 degrees to the horizontal. We also found that it is
desirable to release the ball as high above the ground as possible, as long as this
does not adversely affect the player's launch consistency.

25895702	The preparatory state of ground reaction forces in defending against a dribbler in a	"We previously demonstrated the relationship between sidestepping performance and the preparatory state of ground reaction forces (GRFs). The present study investigated
the effect of the preparatory state of GRFs on defensive performance in 1-on-1
subphase of basketball. Ten basketball players participated in 1-on-1 dribble game
of basketball. The outcomes (penetrating and guarding) and the preparatory state of
GRFs (non-weighted and weighted states, i.e. vertical GRFs below and above 120% of
body weight, respectively) were assessed by separating the phases. In the
non-weighted state and the weighted state to determine the outcome, the probability
of successful guarding was 78.8% and 29.6%, respectively. The non-weighted state
prevented delay of the defensive step in the determination phase. Both the
non-weighted and weighted states, immediately before the determination phase, were
likely to change to the weighted state in the determination phase; during this time,
the defender's preparatory state would be destabilised, presumably by the dribbler's
movement. These results revealed that the preparatory GRFs before the defensive step
help to explain the outcome of the 1-on-1 subphase, and suggest a better way to
prevent delaying initiation of the defensive step and thereby to guard more
effectively against a dribbler.

29129134	Divided attention during cutting influences lower extremity mechanics in female	"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in basketball appear to be more common when players are in possession of the ball. The greater risk of ACL injury when in
possession of the ball may result from the athlete's inability to fully attend to
their movement. However, it is also possible that having to carry/manipulate the
ball restricts the athlete's ability to utilise their upper extremities for
stability during a manoeuvre. The purpose of this study was to explore how
possession of a basketball and divided attention influence lower extremity mechanics
during cutting and landing. Twenty uninjured females with basketball experience
performed a baseline lateral cutting task, as well as lateral cuts while carrying a
basketball, with and without a subsequent chest pass. Requiring participants to
carry the basketball in isolation (i.e., without the additional pass) had minimal
influence on lower extremity mechanics compared to baseline. However, participants
demonstrated less knee flexion (40.9° vs. 47.3°) and greater knee abduction (12.2°
vs. 10.1°) for trials that included the additional pass (divided attention
condition) compared to trials conducted while carrying the basketball in isolation.
Athletes may be at greater risk for ACL injury when they are unable to solely attend
to their movement.

to be most prominent for the attacking patterns. The novel addition of both forward
and backward scenes may provide a more precise measure of the anticipatory effect,
suggesting that future research in this domain should use a similar methodological
design.

20391881	An analysis of defensive strategies used by home and away basketball teams.	"The aim of the present study was to identify differences in defensive strategies used during basketball games, to compare the defensive strategies used by home and
away basketball teams, and to analyze the effectiveness of home and away ball
possessions when playing against each defensive strategy. The sample was composed of
10 games of the Spanish men's 2005-2006 regular basketball season (N = 1,785 ball
possessions). The analyzed variables were the number of types of defenses used,
points per possession, foul percentage, and turnover percentage according to the
type of defensive strategy and game location. The game location main effect was
significant in points per possession, with home teams having lower values than away
teams. The defensive strategy main effect was significant in number of types of
defenses used, with man-to-man as the most frequently utilized defense, and foul
percentages with higher values in zone defenses. There was a statistically
significant interaction in turnover percentages, with significantly lower values for
man-to-man defense and home games. Overall, it is suggested that team performance
for the studied variables changed according to the factors and, thus, it may be
beneficial to change defensive (and offensive) strategies according to game
location.

11083144	Kinematic adjustments in the basketball jump shot against an opponent.	"The aim of this study was to analyse the adjustments in technique made by a basketball player when shooting against an opponent. The subjects used consisted of
10 professional basketball players of the Spanish First Division League.
Three-dimensional motion analysis based on video recordings (50 Hz) was used to
obtain the kinematic characteristics of basketball jump shots with and without an
opponent. It was found that when performing against an opponent the release angle of
the ball increased, the flight time was reduced and postural adjustments as
determined by the angles at the knee and shoulder increased, all significantly.
There were several other non-significant differences that helped to interpret the
changes in technique imposed by the presence of an opponent. It was suggested that
when shooting with an opponent, players attempted to release the ball more quickly
and from a greater height. This strategy will lessen the chance of the opponent
intercepting the ball. It was concluded that the differences noted in the technical
execution of the skill had implications for practice. It was suggested that training
would benefit from practice with an opponent for at least some of the time to
condition players to the demands which they were more likely to meet in the game
situation.

25549511	From the wrong point of view! Athletes' ability to identify structured playing	"In professional basketball, coaches commonly use time-outs to instruct players on the upcoming playing pattern. In an explorative study a total of 154 time-outs in
professional basketball were analyzed and the data revealed that coaches usually
present these playing patterns from their own viewing perspective on the tactic
board. This habit leads to a misalignment of the instructed playing pattern with the
viewing perspective of players, so that they have to mentally rotate the pattern's
spatial-temporal information before they can execute the action on the court. In an
experimental study thirty-two basketball experts and forty-eight novices watched
video clips of different playing patterns, which were presented from their own or
from a coaches' viewing perspective. Identification performance suffered
significantly for experts and novices when the upcoming pattern was presented upside
down. It is suggested that basketball coaches should align their tactic boards with
the viewing perspective of their athletes during time-outs.

20453682	Differences in strength and conditioning coach self-perception of leadership style	"Leader behaviors have been found to vary by competitive level (6,9,11,26). Similar differences based on the competitive environment have been reported with strength
coaches and their training emphases (15,28) but not their leadership style
behaviors. This latter area is important to explore because strength coach leader
behaviors may result in enhanced cooperation, improved communication, and improved
athlete psychological and emotional well-being (14,23,25,27). Accordingly, the
purpose of this study was to examine the differences in self-perceived leadership
styles of National Basketball Association, Division I-A (DI-A) men's basketball, and
Division II (DII) men's basketball strength and conditioning coaches. The
self-perceived leadership styles of 145 men's basketball strength coaches (National
Basketball Association [NBA]=22, DI-A=92, and DII=31) were obtained using the
Revised Leadership Scale for Sport (26,41). Frequency data about demographics and
training methods were also collected. No significant differences were reported for
positive feedback. Otherwise, NBA strength coaches reported more democratic
leadership style behaviors than DI-A strength coaches. Division I-A strength coaches
were found to be more autocratic than NBA or DII strength coaches. Both NBA and DI-A
strength coaches indicated a higher level of training and instruction than did DII
strength coaches. National Basketball Association strength coaches also reported
engaging in more situational and socially supportive leader behaviors than DI-A and
DII strength coaches. Leader behaviors can positively and negatively impact an
athlete (23); thus, strength coaches need to evaluate their competitive environment
and reflect on the impact of their behaviors and how their approach to leading
athletes may need to vary based on the situation.

26985809	"The Spanish ""Century XXI"" academy for developing elite level basketballers: design,"	"OBJECTIVES: The XXI Century Academy was a 6-year state-initiated intervention program that served as an alternative to basketball clubs for players in the u-14
and u-18 age groups in Spain, under guidelines established by the Spanish Basketball
Federation. It was an important and unique project on talent development in
basketball. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no evidence has been reported on
long-term athlete development programs in basketball worldwide. The main aim of this
report is to describe the design and evaluation methods used for the XXI Century
Academy as a long-term intervention program in the elite Spanish Basketball Academy,
aiming to prepare basketball players to compete at the elite level. METHODS: The
monitoring time lasted from 1996 to 2001. A total of 55 players were assigned to the
intervention groups based on age, position, maturation level, and country of origin.
During this process, participants competed in up to two categories in addition to
playing competitive official matches worldwide in international tournaments in their
categories and with the national team in the European and World Championships (u-14
- u-18). Participants included 1 NBA player, 3 national A Team players, 10 ACB
(First Spanish League) players, 5 LEB (second League) players and 39 LEB-2 EBA
(third League) players. Assessments took place in a High-Performance Sports Center
(CPT FADURA-GETXO- Basque Government, Getxo, Vizcaya, Spain) and consisted of health
questionnaires, anthropometric measures, blood parameters, maturation level, birth
age, fitness tests, training volume and intensity, physical activity, technical and
tactical training, dietary intake, supplementation and injuries. Each player was
assessed 4 times per year (September, December, April, June) for 4 years (16 data
points). RESULTS: This is a purely methodological paper describing the design and
evaluation methods used in the XXI Century Project, which will be used as a basis
for future reporting of results. Therefore, the results of the project will be
reported in subsequent publications. CONCLUSION: The viability of the Century XXI
Project protocols has been described. This national project of training in
basketball closely replicates the physical and technical match-play conditions for
professionals and may constitute a useful training tool.

22465899	Suggestions from the field for return to sports participation following anterior	"The purpose of this paper is to outline the final, functional phases of rehabilitation that address exercises, drills, and return-to-play criteria for the
sport of basketball, following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. ACL
injuries can be debilitating and affect the quality of life for recreational and
elite athletes alike. Tears of the ACL are common in both male and female basketball
players, with a higher incidence rate in females. Incidence of a retear to the
existing graft or contralateral knee within 5 years of ACL reconstruction with
patellar tendon autograft in young (less than 18 to 25 years of age), active
basketball players can be as high as 52%. Reducing the number of ACL injuries or
reinjury, of which there are an estimated 80 000 per year at an associated cost of
over a billion dollars, can have significant potential long-term fiscal and health
benefits. Following surgical reconstruction of the ACL, implementing a tailored
rehabilitation protocol can ensure a successful return to sport. When searching the
literature for such protocols, clinicians may struggle to find specific exercises,
drills, and return-to-play criteria for particular sports. The intent of this
manuscript is to present such a rehabilitation protocol for basketball.

1554067	Incidence of lateral meniscus injury in professional basketball players.	"We reviewed National Basketball Trainers Association data over a 6-year period to determine the incidence of lateral meniscus injury among professional basketball
players. Our results indicated that 58% of all injuries involved the lateral
meniscus, while 42% involved the medial meniscus. This differs from what other
authors have reported for basketball players. The lateral meniscus may be vulnerable
to chronic injury and subject to microtrauma from repetitive submaximal stresses
associated with cutting or changing direction while running, or from pivoting. A
professional player is at more risk of injury during a game than practice, and thus
is exposed to injury more than a collegian because the professional season has three
to four times as many games. Also, magnetic resonance imaging may aid the physician
in accurately diagnosing some tears that would otherwise have gone undetected or
required arthroscopy for diagnosis. In addition, injury to the lateral meniscus
could produce secondary symptoms such as instability or patellofemoral pain to
structures other than the lateral meniscus.

differed further in having high, medium, and low experience in the sports. For
comparisons across sports, the basketball and the baseball players had significantly
shorter reaction times than the nonathletes in both tasks. In contrast, reaction
times varied significantly across experience for the baseball players in the Go/NoGo
RT task but not for basketball players. These results suggested that Go/NoGo RT
could be used as an index of expertise for sport-specific decision-making, if

30932038	Prior shared success predicts victory in team competitions.	"Debate over the impact of team composition on the outcome of a contest has attracted sports enthusiasts and sports scientists for years. A commonly held belief regarding
team success is the superstar effect; that is, including more talent improves the
performance of a team(1). However, studies of team sports have suggested that
previous relations and shared experiences among team members improve the mutual
understanding of individual habits, techniques and abilities and therefore enhance
team coordination and strategy(2-9). We explored the impact of within-team
relationships on the outcome of competition between sports teams. Relations among
teammates consist of two aspects: qualitative and quantitative. While quantitative
aspects measure the number of times two teammates collaborated, qualitative aspects
focus on 'prior shared success'; that is, whether teamwork succeeded or failed. We
examined the association between qualitative team interactions and the probability
of winning using historical records from professional sports-basketball in the
National Basketball Association, football in the English Premier League, cricket in
the Indian Premier League and baseball in Major League Baseball-and the multiplayer
online battle game Defense of the Ancients 2. Our results show that prior shared
success between team members significantly improves the odds of the team winning in
all sports beyond the talents of individuals.

19424898	Officiating bias: the effect of foul differential on foul calls in NCAA basketball.	"In this study, we examined the pattern of foul calls exhibited during 365 NCAA basketball games during the 2004-2005 season. Results of the analysis indicate that
officials are more likely to call fouls on the team with the fewest fouls, making it
likely that the number of fouls will tend to even out during the game. This
increased probability increases as the foul differential increases. In addition,
there is a significant bias towards officials calling more fouls on the visiting
team, and a bias towards foul calls on the team that is leading. The result is that
the probability of the next foul being called on the visiting team can reach as high
as 0.70. Finally, the implications of this officiating bias are explored, including
the fact that basketball teams have an incentive to play more aggressively, leading
to more physical play over time.

25144982	Morphological profile of different types of top young female European basketball	"Basketball is a team sport involving several types of players who differ in terms of body height and other morphological dimensions. This study aimed to establish and
analyze the morphological characteristics of top young female European basketball
players, the development levels of the morphological characteristics of three basic
types of such players and any differences among them. The sample of subjects
comprised 115 female basketball players aged 14.64 (+/- 0.48) years. They were
divided into three groups according to their playing position: guard (N = 51),
forward (N = 33) and center (N = 31). The study applied 23 morphological measures,
based on which the somatotype components, percentages of bone, muscle and fat tissue
and other morphological indexes were calculated. Statistically significant
differences (p < 0.05) were established between individual types of players in terms
of their body height, body mass and the three somatotype components, by using a
one-way analysis of variance, whereas no such differences were identified in terms
of their bone, muscle and fat tissue percentages. There were no differences even
after the effect of body height was eliminated by using a multivariate analysis of
covariance. The effect of the covariate was only statistically significant in terms
of bone tissue percentage. The results of the study thus refute the assumption that
it is possible to differentiate player types according to their proportions of fat
and muscle tissue.

The performances of 8 elite male players and 8 average-level players were compared
in order to identify which components of fitness among agility, speed, anaerobic
power, anaerobic capacity, and upper body strength were key determinants of
performance in modern basketball. Each subject performed 7 tests, including vertical
jump (VJ), 20-m sprint, agility T test, suicide sprint, 30-second Wingate anaerobic
test (WAnT), isokinetic testing of the knee extensors, and 1 repetition maximum
(1RM) bench press test. The statistical difference in the anaerobic performances was
assessed by Student's t test. The main results showed that, compared to
average-level players, elite-level players achieved significantly better
performances in the agility T test (+6.2%), VJ test (+8.8%), peak torques developed
by knee extensors (+20.2%), and 1RM bench press (+18.6%, p < 0.05). In contrast, no
significant difference between groups was observed on 20-m sprint, suicide run, and
parameters of the WAnT (p > 0.05). These results emphasized the importance of
anaerobic power in modern basketball, whereas anaerobic capacity does not seem to be
a key aspect to consider. In this context, coaches are advised to avoid using
exercises lasting >/=30 seconds in their physical fitness programs, but instead to
focus on short and intense tests such as VJ, agility T test, and sprints over very
short distances (5 or 10 m).

(age 28 +/- 3.6 years, height 199 +/-7.2 cm, body mass 102 +/- 11.5 kg, and body fat
10.4 +/- 1.5%) whose heart rate (HR) was recorded during each training session and
their individual response to TL monitored using the session-rate of perceived
exertion (RPE) method (200 training sessions). The association between the
session-RPE method and training HR was used to assess the population validity of the
session-RPE method. Significant relationships were observed between individual
session-RPE and all individual HR-based TL (r values from 0.69 to 0.85; p < 0.001).
Coaches spontaneously provided a tapering phase during the competitive weeks
irrespective of the number of games played during it (i.e., 1 or 2 games). The
individual weekly players' TL resulted in being not significantly different from
each other (p > 0.05). Elite male professional basketball imposes great
physiological and psychological stress on players through training sessions and
official competitions (1-2 per week). Consequently, the importance of a practical
and valid method to assess individual TL is warranted. In this research, we
demonstrated that session-RPE may be considered as a viable method to asses TL
without the use of more sophisticated tools (i.e., HR monitors). The session-RPE
method enabled the detection of periodization patterns in weekly planning in elite
professional basketball during the crucial part of the competitive season (1 vs. 2
weekly fixtures model).

movement data of each player were obtained for analysis of team behaviours in both
the longitudinal (basket-to-basket) and lateral (side-to-side) directions. The
central position of a team was measured using its spatial (geometric) centre and
dispersion using a stretch index, obtained from the mean distance of team members
from the spatial centre. Relative-phase analysis of the spatial centres demonstrated
in-phase stabilities in both the longitudinal and lateral directions, with more
stability in the longitudinal than lateral direction. As anticipated, this finding
is consistent with the results of an analysis of individual playing dyads (see
companion article, this issue), as well as the more general principle of complex
systems conforming to similar descriptions at different levels of analysis. Phase
relations for the stretch index demonstrated in-phase attraction in the longitudinal
direction and no attraction to any values in the lateral direction. Finally, the
difference between the two stretch indexes at any instant showed phase transitions
between two stable patterns when the difference was represented in binary form. This
result is attributed to the reciprocity between teams in their amounts of expansion
and contraction when possession of the ball is won and lost.

23876006	Laterality of a second player position affects lateral deviation of basketball	"Asymmetrically placed visual distractors are known to cause a lateral bias in the execution of a movement directed toward a target. The aim of the present experiment
was to verify if the trajectory of the ball and the trajectory of the jump for a
basket-shot can be affected by the sole position of a second player, who stays in
front of the shooting player in one of three possible positions (centre, left or
right) but too far to physically interfere with the shot. Young basketball players
were asked to perform 60 shots at 6.25 m from a regular basket, with or without a
second player staying in front of them in, alternately, a centre, left or right
position. A computerised system measured the angular deviation of the jump direction
from the vertical direction and the lateral deviation of the ball trajectory from
the midline. The results showed that both the jump direction and the entry position
of the ball deviated toward the opposite side from the second player's side;
however, these effects were too small to significantly affect the mean goal
percentage. This result confirms that some placements of the players can have an
effect as visual distractors. Further studies are necessary to find what game
conditions can make such distractors harmful for the athletic performance.

collegiate basketball athletes (men = 9, women = 7) and in a healthy nonathlete
control group (men = 7, women = 9). Each participant performed the SEBT with their
dominant and nondominant limbs on stable and unstable testing surfaces while
reaching in the anterior, medial, and posterior directions. No significant
differences resulted between the dominant and nondominant limbs (p > 0.05).
Significant differences were found between the basketball and control groups in all
directions (p < 0.01) and the average reach score (p < 0.01) with the control group
reaching 6-7% farther than the basketball group. A significant main effect for
gender (collapsed across group and limb) was present in the posterior direction (p =
0.02). The SEBT performance in the medial and posterior directions and the average
score were significantly (p < 0.01) reduced during testing on the unstable surface.
These results suggest that athletic status may be a factor to consider when
interpreting SEBT reach performance. Future research should examine the influence of
SEBT testing in other athletic populations. Further, use of an unstable surface
provided a greater challenge to balance. Additional research may provide insight
into the role of using an unstable surface with the SEBT as part of an injury risk
assessment and its use in identifying limb differences between injured and uninjured
limbs.

program, 3 d·wk(-1) for approximately 90-120 minutes per session. The program was
conducted on the basketball court and in weight room facilities in high schools. The
athletes underwent a video drop-jump test, multistage fitness test, vertical jump
test, and an 18-m sprint test before and upon completion of the training program.
All the subjects attended at least 14 training sessions. After training, a
significant increase was found in the mean estimated VO2max (p < 0.001), with 89% of
the athletes improving this score. In the drop-jump video test, significant
increases were found in the mean absolute knee separation distance (p < 0.0001) and
in the mean normalized knee separation distance (p < 0.0001), indicating a more
neutral lower limb alignment on landing. A significant improvement was found in the
vertical jump test (p < 0.0001); however, the effect size was small (0.09). No
improvement was noted in the sprint test. This program significantly improved lower
limb alignment on a drop-jump test and estimated maximal aerobic power and may be
implemented preseason or off-season in high school female basketball players.

14986192	Training-induced changes in aerobic aptitudes of professional basketball players.	"We investigated the effects of a training program on the aerobic aptitudes and the relevance of the instant of equality of pulmonary gas exchange (i. e., RER = 1.00)
to assess these effects in professional basketball players. Eight athletes performed
two incremental exercise tests on a cycloergometer separated by 4.7 +/- 0.7 months.
Physiological variables recorded during these two tests (heart rate, oxygen uptake,
carbon dioxide output, respiratory exchange ratio, power output) allowed to
determine the first and second ventilatory thresholds and the instant of equality of
pulmonary gas exchange. The training program induced significant variations of
resting heart rate, oxygen uptake and power output measured for the instant of
equality of pulmonary gas exchange. Moreover, the used fractions of heart rate,
oxygen uptake and power reserves for the instant of equality of pulmonary gas
exchange and the second ventilatory threshold increase significantly. Inversely,
maximal oxygen uptake, maximal power reached and the used fractions of reserves for
the first ventilatory threshold do not differ significantly. Professional basketball
training is not focused on drills aiming to enhance both the aerobic power and
aptitude, our results suggest that this training program induce the same
physiological changes as a typical aerobic training. We also demonstrated that the
instant of equality of pulmonary gas exchange is a powerful tool to quantify the
changes in aerobic aptitudes during a sport season.

17262153	Ground reaction force in basketball cutting maneuvers with and without ankle bracing	"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: In basketball, the most common injuries are ankle sprains. For this reason, players frequently use external ankle devices or taping as
prophylactic and rehabilitation measures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
ground reaction force (GRF) responses in basketball players while performing typical
cutting maneuvers with and without ankle bracing and ankle taping. DESIGN AND
SETTING: Comparative study with experimental design of single-group repeated
measurements, at Medical Rehabilitation Division, Hospital das Clínicas, Faculdade
de Medicina, Universidade de São Paulo. METHODS: Vertical (Fy) and medial-lateral
(Fz) GRF measurements were made under three conditions (taping, Aircast-type
orthosis and basketball shoes alone), with analysis of peak forces at foot contact
(Fymax1, Fzmax1, Fymax2 and Fzmax2), growth gradient (peak/time) (GG Fymax1, GG
Fzmax1, GG Fymax2 and GG Fzmax2) and impulse after foot contact. RESULTS: Bracing
significantly reduced Fymax2 and GG Fymax2. GG Fzmax1 was significantly higher for
the sport shoe condition than for the taping condition. Taping increased Fy in
relation to the sport shoe at foot contact, but over a longer time interval, without
increasing excessive ankle loading. Fz reached a peak in less time, which might
generate greater inversion/eversion loading on a player's foot. The Aircast exerted
better shock-absorbing effect than did the other two conditions, since it generated
less vertical force over longer time intervals and smaller medial-lateral forces in
relation to taping. CONCLUSIONS: Ankle bracing and ankle taping action mechanisms
are still unclear and therefore should be carefully prescribed. More studies are
needed to clarify taping and bracing effects on sporting activities.

19793219	Relationship between aerobic and anaerobic parameters and functional classification	"Participation in sports for individuals with disabilities continues to gain popularity. In order to provide fair and equitable competition among persons with
different disabilities and functional capacity, a separate functional classification
system has been devised for each sport. The aims of the present study were to
evaluate aerobic and anaerobic performance of wheelchair basketball athletes and
verify a correlation with the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation
functional classification system. For this, 17 highly trained male Brazilian
basketball wheelchair athletes (25.4+/-4.4 years) from the national team who had
taken part in the Athens 2004 Paralympic Games were assessed. These athletes were
submitted to cardiopulmonary exercise testing and Wingate-like 30-s sprint test
using upper limbs. The present study demonstrated that the functional classification
score correlated with relative (r=0.90; P<0.0001) and absolute peak power (r=0.50;
P=0.0353) and absolute mean power (r=0.93; P<0.0001) obtained from the Wingate-like
30-s sprint test and also correlated with absolute O(2) peak (r=0.68; P=0.0026) and
O(2) at ventilatory threshold (r=0.71; P=0.0014), measured on cardiopulmonary
exercise testing. Therefore, our findings support the functional classification
created to classify athletes' functional capability on the court, which also
correlated with aerobic and anaerobic performance parameters of the elite wheelchair
basketball players.

21914903	"""What's the difference?"" women's wheelchair basketball, reverse integration, and the"	"The inclusion of able-bodied athletes within disability sport, a phenomenon known as reverse integration, has sparked significant debate within adapted physical
activity. Although researchers and practitioners have taken up positions for or
against reverse integration, there is a lack of supporting research on the
experiences of athletes who already play in such settings. In this study, we explore
how competitive female athletes who have a disability experience reverse integration
in Canadian wheelchair basketball. Athletic identity was used as the initial
conceptual framework to guide semistructured interviews with nine participants. The
results suggest that participation in this context contributed to positive athletic
identities. Interviews also pointed to the unexpected theme of ""what's the
difference?"" that this sporting context provided a space for the questioning and
creative negotiation of the categories of disability and able-bodiedness.
Methodologically, this paper also explores the possibilities and challenges of
inter- worldview and insider-outsider research collaboration.

22327082	Long-term effects of whole-body vibration training in high-level female basketball	"AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) training on the jumping capabilities of high-level female basketball
players. METHODS: A 12-week WBV program was applied to 10 national and international
level female basketball players. They were randomly distributed into a control group
(CG: 23.2±3.96 years, 69.64±11.17 kg, 179.7±7.96 cm) and an experimental group (VG:
24.0±2.65 years, 70.17±9.86 kg, 181.9±10.83 cm). In order to determine the effects
of the WBV program on the jumping capabilities of the subjects, the following tests
were used: SJ, CMJ, ACMVJ, and 15-seconds maximal jump. RESULTS: In the SJ test, the
CG significantly increased from 455.4±25.91 to 476.6±26.6 ms (+4.42%; P=0.05), while
the VG also increased significantly from 455±15.62 to 478.33±16.56 ms (+5.13%;
P=0.02). In the CMJ test, the CG significantly increased from 470.2±12.15 to
496±23.38 ms (+5.49%; P=0.04), while the VG remained unchanged: 472±15.62 to
474.67±8.74 ms (+0.76%). In the ACMVJ test, the CG increased from 514±37.67 to
520±15.5 ms (+1.42%), while the VG decreased from 515±31.43 to 510.33±16.56 ms
(-0.77%). In the 15-seconds jump test, the CG increased from 459±23.48 to
481.6±15.53 ms (+5.15%), while the VG increased from 464±36.66 to 471±33.96 ms
(+1.6%). In this same test, the power generated by the CG increased from 20.01±1.84
to 22.14±2.21 W/kg (+11.12%), while the VG increased from 17.28±2.39 to 22.21±5.82
W/kg (+29.7%). CONCLUSION: WBV has no extra appreciable effect or benefit on the
jumping capabilities of high-level female basketball players compared to regular
strength training methods.

20136758	Relative age is associated with sport dropout: evidence from youth categories of	"The aim of the current research was to investigate the relative age effect (RAE) as a factor of basketball dropout. In order to do so, we examined the distribution of
birth dates of young male (n=44,498) and female (n=30,147) French basketball players
who have dropped out this sport during or at the end of the 2005-2006 season. χ(2)
analyses showed an underrepresentation of dropouts among male players born early in
the competition year and an overrepresentation among those born late in the ""9-10
years old,""""11-12 years old,"" and ""13-14 years old"" categories and in the first year
of the ""15-17 years old"" category. Concerning girls, this asymmetry was observed
across the same age categories. For both boys and girls, there was no biased
distribution in the ""7-8 years old"" category. Findings of the present study confirm
that the RAE should be taken into consideration in studies about sport dropout as a
variable that may influence this phenomenon significantly.

20131146	Space-time coordination dynamics in basketball: Part 1. Intra- and inter-couplings	"We examined space-time patterns of basketball players during competition by analysing movement data obtained from six game sequences. Strong in-phase relations
in the longitudinal (basket-to-basket) direction were observed for all playing
dyads, especially player-opponent dyads matched for playing position, indicating
that these movements were very constrained by the game demands. Similar findings for
in-phase relations were observed for the most part in the lateral direction, the
main exception being dyads comprising the two wing players from the same team. These
dyads instead demonstrated strong attractions to anti-phase, a consequence perhaps
of seeking to increase and decrease team width in tandem. Single instances from
select dyads and game sequences demonstrated further evidence of phase stabilities
and phase transitions on some occasions. Together, these findings demonstrate that
space-time movement patterns of playing dyads in basketball, while unique,
nonetheless conform to a uniform description in keeping with universal principles of
dynamical self-organizing systems as hypothesized.

18978628	An intensive combined training program modulates physical, physiological,	"The purpose of this study was the investigation of the effects of an intensive combined training program based on the pretest scores of a university women's
basketball team on their physical, physiological, biomotoric, and technical
features. Twenty-four university volunteers were equally divided into two groups: an
experiment group (intensive combined training group) and a control (technical
training) group. The 10-week intensive combined training program was performed on
the experiment group according to their pretest outcomes. Before and at the end of
each period of training, which was scheduled four times a week, the physical,
physiological, biomotoric, and technical performance of each subject were
determined. With respect to the pre- and posttest measurements, the basketball group
showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in girth measurements (shoulder, waist,
hip, arm, thigh, and calf), in skinfold measurements (percent body fat), in
physiological measurements (vital capacity and forced vital capacity), in biomotoric
tests (right-left hand grip, dynamic and countermovement jump, sit-up, push-up,
1500-m endurance), and in technique tests (free and inside shooting). It can be
concluded that a 10-week intensive combined training program performed on university
women basketball players had a significant effect on improving their physical,
physiological, biomotoric, and technical features. It proved to be highly
recommendable for female basketball players who are preparing for short-term
tournaments; the basketball group in this study won a championship.

22505125	Predicting performance and injury resilience from movement quality and fitness	"The purpose of this study was to see if specific tests of fitness and movement quality could predict injury resilience and performance in a team of basketball
players over 2 years (2 playing seasons). It was hypothesized that, in a basketball
population, movement and fitness scores would predict performance scores and that
movement and fitness scores would predict injury resilience. A basketball team from
a major American university (N = 14) served as the test population in this
longitudinal trial. Variables linked to fitness, movement ability, speed, strength,
and agility were measured together with some National Basketball Association (NBA)
combine tests. Dependent variables of performance indicators (such as games and
minutes played, points scored, assists, rebounds, steal, and blocks) and injury
reports were tracked for the subsequent 2 years. Results showed that better
performance was linked with having a stiffer torso, more mobile hips, weaker left
grip strength, and a longer standing long jump, to name a few. Of the 3 NBA combine
tests administered here, only a faster lane agility time had significant links with
performance. Some movement qualities and torso endurance were not linked. No
patterns with injury emerged. These observations have implications for preseason
testing and subsequent training programs in an attempt to reduce future injury and
enhance playing performance.

19485689	Experts appear to use angle of elevation information in basketball shooting.	"For successful basketball shooting, players must use information about the location of the basket relative to themselves. In this study, the authors examined to what
extent shooting performance depends on the absolute distance to the basket (m) and
the angle of elevation (alpha). In Experiment 1, expert players took jump shots
under different visual conditions (light, one dot glowing on the rim in the dark,
and dark). Task performance was satisfactory under the one-dot condition, suggesting
that m and alpha provided sufficient information during movement execution. In
Experiment 2, expert wheelchair basketball players performed shots binocularly and
monocularly, under one-dot and light conditions. Performance under the one-dot
condition was similar binocularly and monocularly, suggesting that distance
information was not crucial for the online control of shooting. In Experiment 3,
experts took jump shots under light, one-dot, and dark conditions while the basket's
height was varied between trials unbeknownst to the participants. Players relied on
alpha in combination with the official basket's height to guide their shooting
actions. In conclusion, basketball shooting appears to be based predominantly on
angle of elevation information.

identify the phases of a sidestep cutting maneuver that place athletes at a greater
risk for ACL injuries. METHODS: Ten healthy female collegiate basketball athletes
were asked to perform sidestep cutting movements; the knee flexion and valgus angles
as well as the electromyographic activity of the vastus lateral, vastus medial,
biceps femoris, and semimembranosus muscles of the non-dominant leg were analyzed
during the maneuver. RESULTS: The mean knee valgus angle peak tended to be greater
during the stop phase than during the side-movement phase. The quadriceps activation
during the stop phase was significantly higher than that during the side-movement
phase. Moreover, the ratio of hamstring to quadriceps muscle activation during the
stop phase was significantly lower than that during the side-movement phase, as
assessed by surface electromyography. CONCLUSION: Female basketball athletes have a
higher risk for ACL injury during the stop phase than during the side-movement phase
of the sidestep cutting maneuver. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

20147540	Mental hoop diaries: emotional memories of a college basketball game in rival fans.	"The rivalry between the men's basketball teams of Duke University and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC) is one of the most storied traditions in college
sports. A subculture of students at each university form social bonds with fellow
fans, develop expertise in college basketball rules, team statistics, and individual
players, and self-identify as a member of a fan group. The present study capitalized
on the high personal investment of these fans and the strong affective tenor of a
Duke-UNC basketball game to examine the neural correlates of emotional memory
retrieval for a complex sporting event. Male fans watched a competitive, archived
game in a social setting. During a subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging
session, participants viewed video clips depicting individual plays of the game that
ended with the ball being released toward the basket. For each play, participants
recalled whether or not the shot went into the basket. Hemodynamic signal changes
time locked to correct memory decisions were analyzed as a function of emotional
intensity and valence, according to the fan's perspective. Results showed
intensity-modulated retrieval activity in midline cortical structures, sensorimotor
cortex, the striatum, and the medial temporal lobe, including the amygdala.
Positively valent memories specifically recruited processing in dorsal
frontoparietal regions, and additional activity in the insula and medial temporal
lobe for positively valent shots recalled with high confidence. This novel paradigm
reveals how brain regions implicated in emotion, memory retrieval, visuomotor
imagery, and social cognition contribute to the recollection of specific plays in
the mind of a sports fan.

20601714	The dark side of visual awareness in sport: Inattentional blindness in a real-world	"Most research in the field of decision making in sports has focused on the bright side of visual attention and has not taken the dark side of visual awareness into
account. Understanding the costs of such inattention should be complementary to the
study of how attention facilitates perception. In the present study, we provide
evidence for the existence of inattentional blindness (IB) in a real-world
basketball setting among adults (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, we found that
players with hardly any basketball experience were more likely to experience IB in a
real-world basketball setting, as compared with experienced athletes. Improving the
ecological validity of the setting by enhancing the perception-action coupling
(Experiment 3) and increasing task difficulty (Experiment 4) did not appear to
affect the occurrence of IB among experienced athletes. IB can be considered a
limitation of the visual system, but it also highlights a critical aspect of visual
processing, which allows us to remain focused on the important aspects of the world.
But as is shown in the present experiments, it is possible to induce an attentional
set--for example, by sport-specific instructions--that leads to players' missing
important game-relevant information.

subjects playing at national level participated in this study. They were divided
into 3 groups according to playing position: guards (positions 1 and 2), forwards
(positions 3 and 4), and centers (position 5). Each subject performed 8 tests
presented in a random order: The 30-second Wingate Anaerobic test (WAnT), isokinetic
testing of the knee extensors, 2 types of jump tests, a 20-m sprint, the agility
T-test, a suicide run, and a basketball chest pass. Statistical differences between
playing positions were assessed using a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
Scheffe post hoc analyses. Results showed that guards performed significantly better
than centers for the relative peak and mean power achieved during the WAnT (+13% and
+16.9%, respectively), relative peak torque of knee extensors (+19.5%), single-leg
jump (+21.8), suicide run (+7.5%), and agility T-test (+6.4%, p < 0.05). In
addition, guards achieved significantly better performances than forwards in the
suicide run test (+7.1%) and forwards were characterized by a greater peak torque of
the knee extensors compared to centers (+22.1%). These results indicate that
specific fitness training must be undertaken according to playing position. The
ability to perform the suicide run, the single-leg jump, and the different movements
involved in the agility T-test must be developed in guards. In contrast, speed over
short distances and strength development of lower body and upper body should be
performed by all playing positions.

predicted age at peak height velocity (APHV). Anthropometric analysis indicated that
elite players were taller, heavier and had a higher percentage of muscle. Further,
physiological testing showed that these elite players perform better in jump,
endurance, speed and agility tests (especially in the agility and ball tests). In
addition, these skills are correlated with point average during the regular season.
More basketball players born in the first semester of the year are selected and
there is a predominance of early-maturing boys among those selected for the elite
team. Those who are more mature have advantages in anthropometric characteristics
and physiological test results. In conclusion, around puberty, physical and
physiological parameters associated with maturity and CA are important in
determining the success of basketball players. These findings should be taken into
account by trainers and coaches, to avoid artificial bias in their selection
choices.

25668077	The hidden cost of coaching: intentional training of shot adequacy discrimination in	"The goal was to identify the advantages and disadvantages of using intentional guidance to teach to discriminate between good and bad circumstances to shoot in
basketball. A simulated shot-adequacy learning task was developed, in which
participants were asked to decide, in each trial, whether the player in possession
of the ball should shoot or not. After each decision, they received feedback on
their response (determined by five cues: Opposition, Rebound, Balance, Alternative,
and Distance). 65 naïve participants (M age = 18.6 yr., SD = 1.3) were divided into
two groups. The Incidental group received no guiding instructions. The Intentional
group was instructed to utilize four of the five cues. The Distance cue was kept
incidental for both groups. Participants effectively incorporated the cues into
their decisions. Guidance had a markedly different effect across cues. The
Intentional group utilized Distance less efficiently than the Incidental group,
i.e., intentional instructions on the other four cues nearly blocked the utilization
of Distance.

19855321	Aerobic and explosive power performance of elite italian regional-level basketball	"The aim of this study was to examine the aerobic fitness and lower-limbs explosive-power abilities of Italian regional-level amateur basketball players.
Participants were basketball players playing successfully at a senior (S, n = 11)
and junior (J, n = 11) regional level. Players maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was
assessed with them wearing a portable gas analyzer (K4b, COSMED, Rome, Italy) during
an exercise mode-specific multistage fitness test (yo-yo endurance test [Yo-Yo]).
Knee extensors and plantar flexors explosive power was assessed with countermovement
jump (CMJ) and stiff-leg jumps (SL), respectively. Jumps were performed using a
switch mat connected to a computer (Muscle Lab, Bosco System, Rome, Italy). Jumps'
fly (FT) and contact times (CT) were used for jump performances calculations.
Stiff-Leg FT versus CT ratio (SL/CT) was considered as representative of lower-leg
explosive power, whereas SL/CMJ.100 was considered as sign of the explosive-power
balance between lower and upper leg muscles. Players' VO2max was 60.88 +/- 6.26 and
50.33 +/- 3.98 mLxkgxmin for J and S, respectively (p < 0.05). A significant
difference was found in SL/CT between S and J players. Yo-Yo performance was not
significantly different between groups (2,055 +/- 267 and 2,020 +/- 174 m for S and
J, respectively, p > 0.05). Lower-leg explosive power showed to be positively
related to distance covered during Yo-Yo. Study results showed that 50 mLxkgxmin is
a sufficient VO2max value for competing at a regional level. Calf explosive power
should be considered to improve sport-specific running performance in basketball
using plyometrics and whole body lifts.

17526624	Rule change incidence on physiological characteristics of elite basketball players:	"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, by examining data collected on professional basketball players during a 10-year period, the differences in aerobic capacity in function of
the playing position and the impact on these parameters of the change in time
regulation of 2000, which shortened the time allowed to attempt a field goal by 6 s
and divided the duration of play in four quarters. METHODS: Twice a year between
1994 and 2004, professional basketball players (n = 68) were studied for
anthropometric characteristics and were submitted to an incremental exercise test on
a cycle ergometer. Statistical analyses were carried out to determine the
interaction between the playing position and the effect of the change in time
regulation on the physiological characteristics of the players. RESULTS:
Anthropometric measurements were different in function of the playing position, the
centres being taller and heavier than the forwards and the guards. Guards exhibited
the highest Vo(2)max (54.0 (SE 1.6) ml/min/kg) and were the most affected by the
change in time regulation of 2000 with a 19.5% increase. Significant main effects of
""before"" versus ""after"" rule changes were found for maximal and submaximal O(2)
consumption, which were increased by 12.8% at ventilatory threshold, 7.3% at
respiratory compensation point and 7.8% at Vo(2)max. CONCLUSION: While
anthropometric characteristics remained constant during the last decade, the change
in rule of 2000 may have contributed in modifying the physiological profile of
basketball players, by generally increasing their level of fitness.

29676222	Clustering performances in the NBA according to players' anthropometric attributes	"The aim of this study was: (i) to group basketball players into similar clusters based on a combination of anthropometric characteristics and playing experience; and
(ii) explore the distribution of players (included starters and non-starters) from
different levels of teams within the obtained clusters. The game-related statistics
from 699 regular season balanced games were analyzed using a two-step cluster model
and a discriminant analysis. The clustering process allowed identifying five
different player profiles: Top height and weight (HW) with low experience,
TopHW-LowE; Middle HW with middle experience, MiddleHW-MiddleE; Middle HW with top
experience, MiddleHW-TopE; Low HW with low experience, LowHW-LowE; Low HW with
middle experience, LowHW-MiddleE. Discriminant analysis showed that TopHW-LowE group
was highlighted by two-point field goals made and missed, offensive and defensive
rebounds, blocks, and personal fouls; whereas the LowHW-LowE group made fewest
passes and touches. The players from weaker teams were mostly distributed in
LowHW-LowE group, whereas players from stronger teams were mainly grouped in
LowHW-MiddleE group; and players that participated in the finals were allocated in
the MiddleHW-MiddleE group. These results provide alternative references for
basketball staff concerning the process of evaluating performance.

arch support influences these forces. Eleven male collegiate basketball players
participated in this study. Electronic pressure sensors capable of dynamic readings
were inserted into the players' shoes, and surface electromyographic (EMG)
electrodes were placed over the peroneus longus and brevis muscles. The players
performed 3 common maneuvers postulated to place maximal stress on the fifth
metatarsal. The maneuvers were performed in a standard basketball shoe, then in a
shoe with an orthosis supporting the arch. During each of these maneuvers, EMG
activity of the ankle everters was recorded, along with maximal force, total work,
and time elapsed beneath the fifth metatarsal.

22185070	Number of players who gain ball possession as a function of basketball mass among	"This study analyzed whether a ball with a higher (540-g) or lower (440-g) mass than the regulation ball (485-g) resulted in a larger number of participants gaining ball
possession during games. Prior studies have indicated that ball handling is
facilitated by decreasing the mass of the ball. It was assumed that a greater number
of children gaining possession of the ball indicated greater ease of use and more
control. Thus, the hypothesis was that the number of participants who gained ball
possession would increase when using a ball of lower mass. The participants were 54
boys from six youth basketball teams. Participants played four games with each one
of the three different balls and the number of possessions was calculated using
videos of each game. The hypothesis was only partially supported: the number of
participants who gained possession with the regular ball was similar to that with
the 440-g ball and with the 540-g ball, but a greater number of participants gained
possession with the 440-g ball in comparison to the 540-g ball. This result suggests
balls that differ by more than 65 g may affect actual game outcomes.

19587184	Identifying and analyzing the construction and effectiveness of offensive plays in	"In the field of sports research, there is a growing need for the rigorous collection of data that provide empirical evidence about the complex reality they refer to.
Although sports psychology research has advanced considerably in recent years, in
both extent and quality, one area of research that remains relatively unexplored is
the dynamics of the sports group and the influence of the group on its members
(George & Feltz, 1995; Widmeyer, Brawley, & Carron, 1992). Key aspects in this
regard include the presence of regularities that are not detectable through visual
inference or traditional methods of data analysis, the lack of standard observation
instruments, and, assuming priority, the need to develop powerful, computerized
coding systems, all of which must form part of an approach that is suitable for
natural and habitual contexts. The present study is part of a broader research
project concerning ACB teams (first Spanish basketball division) and considers the
interaction context before teams try to score (where this is understood as how teams
create scoring opportunities) as the core aspect that links team play. This
investigation proposes a new model of analysis for studying the effectiveness and
construction of offensive basketball plays in order to identify their outcomes, thus
providing coaches with an important device for improving or consolidating them.

21873748	Assessment of anthropological, physical and functional indices in sportsmen	"The goal of the investigation was the estimation of functional condition of anthropometrical, physical and cardiovascular system of sportsmen-basketball players
against the background of high physical loading. 100 basketball players at the age
from 12 till 18 years underlay the study. Randomized and open controllable research
was carried out during 6 months. The following characteristics have been studied:
how many days the sportsman is training in a week, how many hours the sportsman is
training per day, his mood after training, over fatigue and overtension, frequency
of heartbeat, time of breath holding, the general condition, the height in sitting
and standing position; circumference of lumbus, chest, arm and limbs, the pulse,
pulse, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure before and after physical loading.
According to these factors the following sport indices are calculated: Index of Rufe
(physical work capacity), the coefficient of endurance (Kvas formula), Shtange test
(breath holding at sighing), Genchi test (breath holding at exhalation), average
arterial pressure, systolic and cardiac output of blood circulation (the formula of
Lilienstrad and Tsander), the coefficient of blood circulation effectiveness, Ketle
index (the ratio of height and weight), Minuvre index (the ratio of body and feet
length), Pinie index (power of body-build). Statistically authentic increase of
breath and pulse in frequency was observed in sportsmen-basketball players after
physical loading. The study of amplitude parameters of cardiac cycle among
sportsmen-basketball players before and after physical loading has revealed the
ability of rather low adaptation of cardiovascular system to physical loading.

more opportunities to players for whom the false expectation was positive, and fewer
shots to players for whom the false expectation was negative. In turn, players who

shooting ability following the task, than players who were allocated fewer shots.

23914488	Significance and characteristics of the connection between morphological variables	"The purpose of this research was to establish and explain the significance and characteristics of the connection of morphological variables and situation-related
efficiency in basketball players for three basic types of players. Based on the
obtained results, we can claim that the latent morphological structure is not
significantly connected to the applied indexes of situation-related efficiency of
players on the sample of guards and forwards. Further on, there is no significant
influence of the morphological status on the situation-related efficiency of players
in guard and forward positions. On the other hand, latent morphological structure is
significantly connected to all five used indexes of situation-related efficiency of
players on the sample of centres. In accordance with this, optimal morphological
structure of centres in offence involves marked longitudinality, voluminousity and
transversality of the skeleton with unmarked sub-skin adipose tissue. When referring
to the index of the absolute situation-related efficiency of the centres in defence,
it is evident that high quality centres, unlike low quality ones, are characterised
by longitudinality and voluminousity. Further on, AEG index, which includes two
previously mentioned indexes (AEO and AED), describe absolute situation-related
efficiency of the players in offence and defence phase and both indicate that the
morphological structure of high quality centres in both phases of the game consists
of extreme longitudinality of the skeleton, voluminousity and transversality. In
PPLC1 index, three out of four beta-ponders are significant and these are:
longitudinality, voluminousity and transversality. Finally, in PPLC2 index, as well
as in the previously mentioned PPLC1 index, high quality centres differ from low
quality ones in morphological structure which includes marked longitudinality,
voluminousity, transversality and unmarked level of sub-skin adipose tissue.

31365592	NBA team home advantage: Identifying key factors using an artificial neural network.	"What determines a team's home advantage, and why does it change with time? Is it something about the rowdiness of the hometown crowd? Is it something about the
location of the team? Or is it something about the team itself, the quality of the
team or the styles it may or may not play? To answer these questions, season
performance statistics were downloaded for all NBA teams across 32 seasons (83-84 to
17-18). Data were also obtained for other potential influences identified in the
literature including: stadium attendance, altitude, and team market size. Using an
artificial neural network, a team's home advantage was diagnosed using team
performance statistics only. Attendance, altitude, and market size were unsuccessful
at improving this diagnosis. The style of play is a key factor in the home
advantage. Teams that make more two point and free-throw shots see larger advantages
at home. Given the rise in three-point shooting in recent years, this finding
partially explains the gradual decline in home advantage observed across the league
over time.

development. Six female basketball players were selected, representing a range of
playing expertise (pretest: 0-90% baskets scored). Each participant was video
recorded performing 30 shots. Contrary to predictions, there was not a clear pattern
of a reduction in trajectory variability with increasing skill level. However,
improvements in skill level were associated with an increasing amount of intertrial
movement consistency from the elbow and wrist joints. It is suggested that the
angular motions of the elbow and wrist joints were compensated for each other toward
the end of each throw to adapt to subtle changes in release parameters of the ball.

PARTICIPANTS: seven male professional basketball players playing for the defending
champions of the Israel Basketball League participated in this study. EXPERIMENTAL
DESIGN: the POMS was administered seven times (T1-T7) during the season. The initial
POMS administration was performed three weeks following the start of preseason
practice and one day prior to the first basketball game. Each of the other POMS
administrations were performed two days following a game and no more than 2 days
before the next game. RESULTS: Typical iceberg profiles were observed during T1, T2
and T3, which coincided with successful performance (winning percentages greater
than 60% between each POMS administration). Subsequent decreases in performance
between T3 and T4 (a 33% winning percentage) resulted in a decrease in vigor and an
increase in anger. As team performance improved between T4 and T5 (winning
percentage again above 60%), vigor returned to its original level. However, the mood
states anger and depression remained elevated, even during successful team play.
This may have been related to problems independent of basketball performance
(coaching and financial). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the mood state
vigor may be reflective of team performance. In addition, mood states appear to be
influenced more by performance or experience, rather than performance being
influenced by changes in mood states.

19209081	Lower-extremity strength profiles and gender-based classification of basketball	"Despite an increase in women sports participants and recognition of gender differences in injury patterns (e.g., knee), few normative strength data exist
beyond hamstrings and quadriceps measures. This study had 2 purposes: to assess the
lower-extremity strength of women (W) and men (M) basketball players who were 9-22
years old, and to determine which strength measures most correctly classify the
gender of 12- to 22-year-old athletes. Fifty basketball players (26 W, 24 M) without
ligamentous or meniscal injury performed concentric isokinetic testing of bilateral
hip, knee, and ankle musculature. We identified maximal peak torques for the hip
(flexors, extensors, abductors, adductors), knee (flexors and extensors), and ankle
(plantar flexors and dorsiflexors), and we formed periarticular (hip, knee, and
ankle), antigravity, and total leg strength composite measures. We calculated mean
and 95% confidence intervals. With body mass-height normalization, most age and
gender differences were small. Mean values were typically higher for older vs.
younger players and for men vs. women players. Mean values were often lower for
girls 12-13 years vs. those 9-10 years. In the age group of 16-22 years, men had
stronger knee flexors, hip flexors, plantar flexors, and total leg strength than
women. Men who were 16-22 years old had stronger knee flexors and hip flexors than
did younger men and women players. Based on discriminant function, knee strength
measures did not adequately classify gender. Instead, total leg strength measures
had correct gender classifications of 74 and 69% (jackknifed) with significant
multivariate tests (p = 0.025). For researchers and practitioners, these results
support strength assessment and training of the whole lower extremity, not just knee
musculature. Limited strength differences between girls 9-10 years old and those
12-13 years old suggest that the peripubertal period is an important time to target
strength development.

injury. We examined 45 subjects who were participating in a community center
basketball league. Each subject was measured prior to the season for bilateral
weight, quadricep girth, calf girth, Q-angle of the knee, dorsiflexion of the ankle,
forefoot varus, rearfoot valgus, and true and apparent leg length. All lower
extremity injuries causing a game to be missed were recorded during the 16-game
season. Average values for bilateral weight, quadricep girth, Q-angle, rearfoot
valgus, and leg length measures for the injured players were all larger than the
average for the non-injured players by at least one standard deviation. A logistic
regression equation using three of the variables correctly predicted the injury
status of 91% of the players. The three-variable equation was then used
prospectively to predict injury status for members of a small college basketball
team. Only one player missed a game due to injury, and the equation identified that
player as the most likely to be injured. This study demonstrates a strong
relationship between structural measures and lower extremity injury in basketball
players.

basketball players when performing a quick-stop jump shot. In this study, 20 healthy
female college basketball players (mean age 20.5 years) participated. The authors
monitored two groups for 4 weeks: one which trained (n=10) and one which did not
train (n=10). The exercise program emphasized the neutral position of lower
extremities for dynamic alignment control; the players avoided the valgus position
with their knees. Kinematics analysis with a lower extremity angle in the stop
action was performed using three digital video cameras and analyzed using software.
Following the intervention exercise program, each subject was re-evaluated at two
and four weeks to determine changes in movement patterns during the ""sink shot""
task. Two-way analysis of variance models were used to determine differences at
pre-intervention, at mid-term, and post-intervention. After the 2-week intervention,
the trained athletes group made basketball shots with greater change of the lower
extremity motion pattern during the stop action than did non-trained athletes
(p<0.05). However, no significant differences were found between other data of the
2-week and 4-week intervention groups. Results of this study show that two weeks of
training can improve the dynamic alignment control of the lower extremities, as
measured using the alignment angle of the coronal plane and the torsion angle of
horizontal plane during a stop action.

purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different ankle support devices
on four basketball-related performance tests. Eleven female basketball players
underwent four performance tests (vertical jump, jump shot, sprint drill, and
submaximal treadmill run) while wearing five different types of ankle support on
both ankles (no support, tape, Swede-O-Universal, Active Ankle, and Aircast). Ankle
support effect on overall performance was assessed using Friedman's analysis of
variance (ANOVA) by ranks and on specific performance parameters using one-way ANOVA
for repeated measures. Overall performance was impaired by ankle support. The Active
Ankle brace impaired performance the least out of the support devices. Vertical jump
was less with ankle tape as compared with no tape (p < .05), whereas jump shot
accuracy was better with tape as compared with the Swede-O-Universal (p < .05).
Oxygen consumption (VO2) and energy expenditure were higher with the Aircast as
compared with tape (p < .05). It was concluded that the use of ankle support by
female basketball players does adversely affect basketball-related performance
tests, and the prophylactic benefit of bracing needs to be weighed against
performance impairment.

type, medical type, and area of focus. RESULTS: A total of 536 publications met all
inclusion criteria. There were a higher number of articles regarding the NFL (n =
211) and MLB (n = 216) when compared with the NBA (n = 34) or NHL (n = 75). The NFL
had significantly more articles addressing nonorthopedic injuries/medical issues
than were found with the MLB, NBA, or NHL (109 vs 75, 14, 41, respectively). Both
the NFL (33 of 109, 30%) and NHL (6 of 41, 15%) had a relatively high percentage of
articles regarding concussions/neurology, and MLB had a relatively high percentage
of articles dedicated to vascular medicine (13 of 65, 20%). The proportion of
publications dedicated to the knee/lower leg were highest in the NFL (29 of 102,
28%) and NBA (9 of 20, 45%), those dedicated to the shoulder/elbow were highest in
MLB (113 of 151, 75%), and those dedicated to the hip/pelvis were highest in the NHL
(16 of 34, 47%). CONCLUSIONS: The number and type of publications vary among the 4
professional sports leagues, and generally reflect the nature of the sport being
played.

21993034	The relationship between running speed and measures of vertical jump in professional	"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between vertical jump measures and sprint speed over 10, 20, and 40 m in professional basketball players.
Thirty-three professional basketball players aged (±SD) (27.4 ± 3.3 years), body
mass (89.8 ± 11.1 kg), and stature (192 ± 8.2 cm) volunteered to participate in this
study. All participants were tested on squat jump, countermovement jump, and 40-m
running speed. The results show that all jump measures in absolute terms were
correlated significantly to running performance over 10-, 20-, and 40-m sprint
times. None of the jumping performance peak powers and reactive strength were found
to have a correlation to running speed times in absolute term. Furthermore, all jump
height measures relative to body mass except reactive strength had a marked and
significant relationship with all sprint performance times. The results of this
study indicate that while there is a strong and marked relationship between 10-,
20-, and 40-m sprint, there is also a considerable variation within the factors that
contribute to performance over these distances. This may indicate that, separate
training strategies could be implemented to improve running speed over these
distances.

19454769	The influence of anxiety on visual attentional control in basketball free throw	"The aim of this study was to test the predictions of attentional control theory using the quiet eye period as an objective measure of attentional control. Ten
basketball players took free throws in two counterbalanced experimental conditions
designed to manipulate the anxiety they experienced. Point of gaze was measured
using an ASL Mobile Eye tracker and fixations including the quiet eye were
determined using frame-by-frame analysis. The manipulation of anxiety resulted in
significant reductions in the duration of the quiet eye period and free throw
success rate, thus supporting the predictions of attentional control theory. Anxiety
impaired goal-directed attentional control (quiet eye period) at the expense of
stimulus-driven control (more fixations of shorter duration to various targets). The
findings suggest that attentional control theory may be a useful theoretical
framework for examining the relationship between anxiety and performance in
visuomotor sport skills.

significantly more accurate free throws and were able to self-correct their shooting
form more frequently following missed shots than all other groups. Participants who
received three-phase training displayed the most adaptive motivational profile,
characterized by making strategic attributions and adaptive inferences and by using

(c) flexibility development, (d) speed development, (e) plyometrics, (f)
strength/power development, (g) unique aspects, and (h) comments from coaches
providing additional information. Results indicate, in part, that coaches assess an
average of 7.3 parameters of fitness, with body composition testing being the most
common. All coaches used a variety of flexibility development strategies. Results
reveal that 17 of 20 (85.0%) of NBA S&C coaches follow a periodization model.
Nineteen of 20 coaches (95.0%) indicated that their athletes used Olympic-style
lifts. All coaches employed plyometric exercises with their athletes. The squat and
its variations, as well as the Olympic-style lifts and their variations, were the
most frequently used exercises. The survey serves as a review and a source of
applied information and new ideas.

18756894	Game-related statistics that discriminated winning and losing teams from the Spanish	"The purpose of the present study was to analyse men's basketball competitions, trying to identify which game-related statistics allow to discriminate winning and
losing teams. The sample used corresponded to 306 games from the 2004-2005 Regular
Season of the Spanish Men's Professional League. The game-related statistics
gathered were: 2 and 3 points field-goals (both successful and unsuccessful),
free-throws (both successful and unsuccessful), offensive and defensive rebounds,
blocks, assists, fouls, turnovers and steals. The data were analysed in two groups:
balanced games (final score differences equal or below 12 points) and unbalanced
games (final score differences above 12 points). Discriminant analysis allowed to
conclude the following: (i) in balanced games, the variable that best differentiate
both groups were the defensive rebounds; (ii) in unbalanced games, the variables
that discriminate between both groups were the successful 2 points field-goals, the
defensive rebounds and the assists; and (iii) in all games, the statistical analysis
identified two variables that discriminate winning and losing teams (defensive
rebounds and assists). The defensive rebounds were the only game-related statistic
that discriminates both groups in all performed analysis. Coaches and players should
be aware of these different profiles in order to increase knowledge about game
cognitive and motor solicitation and, therefore, to enhance specificity at the time
of practice and game planning.

17685672	Handgrip strength and hand dimensions in young handball and basketball players.	"In handball and basketball the longer the finger length the better the accuracy of the shot or throw. All shots and throws are finished with the wrist and fingers. It
can be proposed that athletes with longer fingers and greater hand surface
parameters also probably have greater grip strength. The aim of this study was to
investigate the influence of general body and hand-specific anthropometric
dimensions on handgrip strength in boys participating in handball and basketball
training. In total, 193 boys aged 10-17 years participated in this study. They were
divided into 6 groups: 10-, 11-, 12-, 13-, 14-15-, and 16-17-year-olds. The body
height and body mass were measured and body mass index was calculated as general
anthropometric parameters. The outlines of the hands of the boys were drawn on paper
with a thin marker. Three groups of hand anthropometric parameters were measured: 5
finger spans, 5 finger lengths, and 5 perimeters of the hand. Handgrip strength was
measured on the dominant hand with a Lafayette dynamometer. As a rule, general
anthropometric parameters determined the maximal handgrip strength more accurately
than did specific hand anthropometric parameters. From the specific hand
anthropometric parameters, finger lengths and perimeters of the hand significantly
correlated with the maximal handgrip strength. In summary, fingers are the smallest,
lightest parts of the motor apparatus, and, therefore, they represent the parts most
easily deflected by force from the ball, but at the same time, finger control is
especially important for the accuracy of different shots, both in handball and
basketball. Thus, it is especially necessary to measure finger length and perimeters
of the hand for practical reasons.

according to playing position and team performance so that univariate analyses of
variance could be administered using absolute size and proportionality data as
dependent variables. Clear differences in absolute size were found between guards,
forwards and centres, but in terms of proportionality the latter two groups
exhibited some similarities, particularly for measures of relative size in upper
body dimensions. With guards displaying a different proportionality profile from
either forwards or centres, the various roles of each position within the team were
considered to rationalize the findings.

18459354	Differences in game-related statistics of basketball performance by game location	"The aim of the present study was to identify game-related statistics that differentiate winning and losing teams according to game location. The sample
included 306 games of the 2004-2005 regular season of the Spanish professional men's
league (ACB League). The independent variables were game location (home or away) and
game result (win or loss). The game-related statistics registered were free throws
(successful and unsuccessful), 2- and 3-point field goals (successful and
unsuccessful), offensive and defensive rebounds, blocks, assists, fouls, steals, and
turnovers. Descriptive and inferential analyses were done (one-way analysis of
variance and discriminate analysis). The multivariate analysis showed that winning
teams differ from losing teams in defensive rebounds (SC = .42) and in assists (SC =
.38). Similarly, winning teams differ from losing teams when they play at home in
defensive rebounds (SC = .40) and in assists (SC = .41). On the other hand, winning
teams differ from losing teams when they play away in defensive rebounds (SC = .44),
assists (SC = .30), successful 2-point field goals (SC = .31), and unsuccessful
3-point field goals (SC = -.35). Defensive rebounds and assists were the only
game-related statistics common to all three analyses.

19180214	Thigh muscle activity, knee motion, and impact force during side-step pivoting in	"CONTEXT: Improving neuromuscular control of hamstrings muscles might have implications for decreasing anterior cruciate ligament injuries in females.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a 6-week agility training program on quadriceps
and hamstrings muscle activation, knee flexion angles, and peak vertical ground
reaction force. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized clinical research trial. SETTING:
Sports medicine research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Thirty female
intramural basketball players with no history of knee injury (age = 21.07 +/- 2.82
years, height = 171.27 +/- 4.66 cm, mass = 66.36 +/- 7.41 kg). INTERVENTION(S):
Participants were assigned to an agility training group or a control group that did
not participate in agility training. Participants in the agility training group
trained 4 times per week for 6 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We used surface
electromyography to assess muscle activation for the rectus femoris, vastus medialis
oblique, medial hamstrings, and lateral hamstrings for 50 milliseconds before
initial ground contact and while the foot was in contact with the ground during a
side-step pivot maneuver. Knee flexion angles (at initial ground contact, maximum
knee flexion, knee flexion displacement) and peak vertical ground reaction force
also were assessed during this maneuver. RESULTS: Participants in the training group
increased medial hamstrings activation during ground contact after the 6-week
agility training program. Both groups decreased their vastus medialis oblique muscle
activation during ground contact. Knee flexion angles and peak vertical ground
reaction force did not change for either group. CONCLUSIONS: Agility training
improved medial hamstrings activity in female intramural basketball players during a
side-step pivot maneuver. Agility training that improves hamstrings activity might
have implications for reducing anterior cruciate ligament sprain injury associated
with side-step pivots.

17530949	Reliability and validity of the performance index evaluation among men's and women's	"The Performance Index Evaluation (PIE) is a basketball-specific assessment of physical performance. The battery consists of items typically included in sport
assessments, such as agility and power, but also addresses an often-overlooked
performance component, namely, core strength. The purpose of this study was to
examine the reliability (test-retest, interrater), validity (criterion-related,
construct-related), and practice effect of the PIE among men's and women's college
basketball players. Test-retest estimates were moderate for men (intraclass
correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.79) and poor for women (ICC = 0.35), but
interrater reliability was high (ICC = 0.95). Criterion-related validity evidence
(i.e., relationship between PIE and playing time) was weak, but construct-related
evidence was acceptable (i.e., college players had higher scores than high school
players). A practice effect was also demonstrated among men. In conclusion,
reliability of the battery should be improved before its use is recommended among
college basketball players. Additionally, the battery does not appear to be a
predictor of performance but does appear to distinguish between skill levels.

29752704	University Sports Rivalries Provide Insights on Coalitional Psychology : Territorial	"Sports are an excellent venue for demonstrating evolutionary principles to audiences not familiar with academic research. Team sports and sports fandom feature dynamics
of in-group loyalty and intergroup competition, influenced by our evolved
coalitional psychology. We predicted that reactions to expressions signaling mutual
team/group allegiance would vary as a function of the territorial context. Reactions
should become more prevalent, positive, and enthusiastic as one moves from the home
territory to a contested area, and from a contested area to a rival's territory
during active rival engagement. We also predicted that men would be more responsive
than women based on sex differences in evolved coalitional psychology. The research
team visited public places immediately prior to 2016-2017 collegiate football and
basketball games. A male research confederate wore a sweatshirt displaying the logo
of one of the competing university teams and vocalized the team's most popular
slogan when he saw a fan displaying similar logos. Observers followed 5 m behind,
recording reactions (N = 597) and response positivity/enthusiasm. Reaction tone was
most positive in the rival territory, least positive in the home territory, and
intermediate in the periphery and contested territory. Rates of ""no reaction"" were
lowest in the rival territory but were highest in the periphery. Men had higher
reaction rates and more positive and enthusiastic reaction tones than women.
Reactions generally followed predictions based on expected signal value. This
project provides evidence that coalitional psychology influences dynamics related to
university sports team rivalries and that context matters for expressions of
alliance.

basketball shooting performance. Ten healthy male basketball players participated in
two simulated '2 on 2 full-court' basketball games. Water consumption was permitted
in one game (Wa) but not in the other (NWa), in a balanced cross-over design.
Subjects began each game euhydrated. All jump tests (squat jump, counter movement
jump, and 30 second jump test) were performed prior to, at half-time, and
immediately following each game (POST). Performance was measured by both field goal
(FG%) and free throw (FT%) percentages recorded during each half. Players incurred a
-1.9 +/- 0.4% body weight loss during NWa. No significant differences were observed
between WA and NWa in anaerobic power, squat jump, or counter movement jump.
However, a 19% difference in anaerobic power (p > 0.05) was observed between Wa
(36.1 +/- 4.8 W.kg-1) and NWa (30.4 +/- 6.6 W.kg-1) at POST. No significant
differences were observed between Wa and NWa in both FG% and FT% however, an 8.1%
decrease (p > 0.05) in FG% was seen between the first and second half during NWa.
Although the decreases in anaerobic power and FG% did not reach significance, the
results suggest that the combination of high intensity, moderate duration exercise,
and fluid restriction might be detrimental to performance.

21494907	Acute exertional medial compartment syndrome of the foot after playing basketball.	"Compartment syndrome of the foot is an uncommon event. The most common cause of compartment syndrome of the foot is a crush injury. Exceedingly rare is acute
compartment syndrome of the foot occurring in the absence of trauma. We describe the
clinical scenario involving a 23-year-old healthy male who developed acute
exertional compartment syndrome isolated to the medial compartment of the foot after

27391409	Influence of acute stress on decision outcomes and heuristics.	"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the take-the-first (TTF) heuristic and decision outcomes in sports under conditions of no, mental, and
physical stress. METHODS: Participants (N.=68) performed 8 video decision-making
trials under each of 3 stress conditions: no stress (counting backwards), mental
stress (mental serial subtraction), and physical stress (running on treadmill at 13
RPE). Prior to each decision-making trial, participants were exposed to 30 seconds
of stress. The decision-making task required participants to watch a video depicting
an offensive situation in basketball and then decide what the player with the ball
should do next. RESULTS: No differences were found between the 3 stress conditions
on TTF frequency, number of options generated, quality of first generated option, or
final decision quality. However, participants performing under conditions of no
stress and physical stress generated their first option and made their final
decision faster than they did when making decisions under mental stress.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results suggest that mental stress impairs decision speed and
that TTF is an ecologically rationale heuristic in dynamic, time-pressured
situations.

14767404	Isokinetic peak torque and hamstring/quadriceps ratios in young basketball players.	"AIM: The purpose of this study was to provide an extensive isokinetic profile, including peak torque and ""functional"" and ""conventional"" muscle group ratios, of
basketball players throughout the developmental years 12-17. Furthermore, we
investigated the effects of age and angular velocity on peak torque and reciprocal
muscle group ratios, and observed the force-velocity pattern. METHODS: Basketball
players (n=180) 12 to 17 years. were divided according to their age in 6 equal
(n=30) groups aged 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 years. All subjects performed maximum knee
extension and flexion efforts at 60 inverted exclamation mark /s and 180 inverted
exclamation mark /s angular velocities under eccentric and concentric conditions.
The absolute (Nm) peak torque was measured, and the relative peak torque (PT/BW) and
""functional"" and ""conventional"" reciprocal muscle group ratio (%) were calculated.
RESULTS: PT/BW values of knee flexors ranged from 0.98 to 2.29 Nm/kg and of
extensors from 1.53 to 3.69 Nm/kg, across all age, velocity, and muscle action
levels. PT/BW was higher at slow speed and during eccentric contraction irrespective
of age and angular velocity/muscle action. The results indicated a significant
(p<0.05) age-related increase in peak torque independent of changes in BW. The
force-velocity patterns were similar across ages. The ""functional"" and
""conventional"" ratios were not affected by age, but increased with increase in
angular velocity, except the CON(KF)/ECC(KE) ratio that was higher (p<0.05) at slow
speed. CONCLUSION: The present study provides an extensive isokinetic profile of a
knee joint in basketball players throughout developmental years 12-17. Coaches and
physical therapist may use these information when evaluating and planning exercise
programs during training and rehabilitation.

11447356	Effects of plyometric training on jumping performance in junior basketball players.	"BACKGROUND: Although the plyometric training has proved its efficiency, it remains generally unknown whether a limited amount of plyometric training could improve
movements in subjects who already demonstrate high level of performance. METHODS:
Three different training regimens were performed in order to study effects of
plyometric training on elite junior basketball players. While control group (CG)
participated only in the regular midseason training activity, another two groups
performed a limited amount of plyometric training employing drop jumps from the
height of either 50 cm (EG-50) or 100 cm (EG-100). The height of the maximal
vertical jump (CMJ), as well as the maximal voluntary force (F) and the rate of
force development (RFD) of hip and knee extensors were tested prior to and after the
training. RESULTS: An increase in CMJ (4.8 and 5.6 cm in EG-50 and EG-100,
respectively), as well as in F of hip extensors and RFD of knee extensors was
observed in both experimental groups, while no significant changes were recorded in
CG. When the pretest scores were used as a covariate, both experimental groups
demonstrated higher increase in CMJ and RFD of knee extensors then CG. However, no
differences were observed between EG-50 and EG-100. The multiple correlation between
four isometric parameters and CMJ revealed R2=0.29. CONCLUSIONS: A limited amount of
plyometric training could improve jumping performance in elite junior basketball
players and this improvement could be partly related with an increase in F of hip
extensors and RFD of knee extensors. However, neither of the two initial heights of
the applied drop jumps proved to be more effective.

19855322	The acute effects of heavy and light resistances on the flight time of a basketball	"The aim of this study was to investigate the acute effect of high-load and low-load complex training on upper-body performance-determined by the flight time of a
basketball push-pass. Twelve competitive male athletes (21.8 +/- 4.5 years, 82.0 +/-
11.7 kg, 181.6 +/- 5.6 cm), with at least 6 months weight training experience and no
musculoskeletal disorders, undertook 3 testing conditions. Condition 1 involved 5
repetitions at 85% of a 1 repetition maximum (1RM) bench press; Condition 2 involved
5 repetitions of a 2.3-kg medicine ball push-pass; and Condition 3 was the control,
where participants rested for the equivalent time of the other conditions (
approximately 20 seconds). Each condition was preceded and followed by an
electronically timed basketball push-pass. Results indicate a significant (3.99%, P
= 0.001) reduction in flight time following the completion of Condition 1 (85% 1RM)
but no significant changes (1.96%, P = 0.154) were seen following Condition 2
(medicine ball push-pass). Furthermore, there was a significant difference (P =
0.016) between Condition 1 (85% 1RM) and Condition 2 (medicine ball throw). This
study appears to confirm previous research suggesting that high loads are required
to elicit a potentiation effect. For those athletes wishing to produce a short-term
enhancement of power, they should consider loads in the region of 85% 1RM. Results
with the lower load showed greater variation, with some individuals responding and
others not. Because there appears to be an individual potentiation response to
lighter loads, we recommend that, when equipment is limited, athletes and coaches
experiment with a range of loads when performing contrast training.

readily visualized on MRI and can be a sign of stress changes. Twenty-six
asymptomatic male National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball players were
imaged before the 2003-2004 season and 14 players were reimaged after the conclusion
of the season with a screening study of long- and short-axis fat-suppressed
T2-weighted images (TR/effective TE, 3,500/56) to identify bone marrow edema in the
metatarsals. CONCLUSION: Six (12%) of 52 feet showed a signal indicating bone marrow
edema in the metatarsals. MRI depicts bone marrow edema in the feet before a
fracture becomes evident. Identification of this edema may reveal stress changes,

20802285	The effect of ankle bracing on peak mediolateral ground reaction force during	"The literature suggests that one-third of ankle injuries sustained during a collegiate basketball season are due to the poor execution of dynamic cutting
movements, leading to increased mediolateral force being placed on the unstable
ankle. The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of ankle bracing
on peak mediolateral ground reaction forces (PMGRF) during sidestep cutting motions
in collegiate basketball players. Ten male collegiate basketball players, with no
previous history of ankle trauma, performed sidestep cutting motions past a static
defensive opponent at speeds between 4.5 and 5.5 meters per second under 2 different
conditions, with and without ankle bracing. Peak mediolateral ground reaction force
was recorded (as a unit of body weight) for each subject in both bracing and control
conditions. The application of an Aircast brace significantly (P = 0.01) reduced
peak mediolateral forces during cutting maneuvers compared with no brace. Results
suggest that the application of an Aircast ankle brace significantly reduces PMGRF
during cutting maneuvers around a static defensive opponent.

9298781	Ankle trauma significantly impairs posture control--a study in basketball players	"Both ankle and hip movements are used to maintain balance in strategies defined as bottom up and top down models. This suggests that pathological impairment of either
of these articulations could modify the parameters of balance control. In order to
appreciate the bearing of ankle damage on the proper control of equilibrium,
posturographic recordings were compared, in a static and two dynamic tests, between
15 professional national basketball players, with histories of 10 to 15 ankle
sprains, and 50 controls. In statokinesigrams obtained with eyes open or closed,
center of foot pressure displacements were of similar length (way) between controls
and players, while the area covered was increased for the latter and related to the
history of ankle trauma. In a toes-up dynamic test (4 degrees, 50 degrees/s) coupled
with electromyographic recordings, the short latency response (myotatic reflex in
the triceps surae muscle) normalized to one meter body height, was shorter in
players without relationship to histories of ankle damage. In a prolonged sinusoidal
dynamic test, players with the largest number of ankle trauma showed greater
difficulties in maintaining posture control. These data pinpoint the role of ankles
in the control of both static and dynamic balance and demonstrate that the role of
the hip joints becomes more important (top down strategy) in the case of damaged
ankles.

20093955	Sequential avulsions of the tibial tubercle in an adolescent basketball player.	"Tibial tubercle avulsion is an uncommon fracture in physically active adolescents. Sequential avulsion of tibial tubercles is extremely rare. We reported a healthy,
active 15-year-old boy who suffered from left tibial tubercle avulsion fracture
during a basketball game. He received open reduction and internal fixation with two
smooth Kirschner wires and a cannulated screw, with every effort to reduce the plate
injury. Long-leg splint was used for protection followed by programmed
rehabilitation. He recovered uneventfully and returned to his previous level of
activity soon. Another avulsion fracture happened at the right tibial tubercle 3.5
months later when he was playing the basketball. From the encouragement of previous
successful treatment, we provided him open reduction and fixation with two
small-caliber screws. He recovered uneventfully and returned to his previous level
of activity soon. No genu recurvatum or other deformity was happening in our case at
the end of 2-year follow-up. No evidence of Osgood-Schlatter disease or osteogenesis
imperfecta was found. Sequential avulsion fractures of tibial tubercles are rare.
Good functional recovery can often be obtained like our case if we treat it well. To
a physically active adolescent, we should never overstate the risk of sequential
avulsion of the other leg to postpone the return to an active, functional life.

29091467	The Future of Classification in Wheelchair Sports: Can Data Science and	"PURPOSE: Classification is a defining factor for competition in wheelchair sports, but it is a delicate and time-consuming process with often questionable validity.
New inertial sensor-based measurement methods applied in match play and field tests
allow for more precise and objective estimates of the impairment effect on
wheelchair-mobility performance. The aim of the present research was to evaluate
whether these measures could offer an alternative point of view for classification.
METHODS: Six standard wheelchair-mobility performance outcomes of different
classification groups were measured in match play (n = 29), as well as best possible
performance in a field test (n = 47). RESULTS: In match results, a clear
relationship between classification and performance level is shown, with increased
performance outcomes in each adjacent higher-classification group. Three outcomes
differed significantly between the low- and mid-classified groups, and 1, between
the mid- and high-classified groups. In best performance (field test), there was a
split between the low- and mid-classified groups (5 out of 6 outcomes differed
significantly) but hardly any difference between the mid- and high-classified
groups. This observed split was confirmed by cluster analysis, revealing the
existence of only 2 performance-based clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The use of inertial
sensor technology to obtain objective measures of wheelchair-mobility performance,
combined with a standardized field test, produced alternative views for
evidence-based classification. The results of this approach provide arguments for a
reduced number of classes in wheelchair basketball. Future use of inertial sensors
in match play and field testing could enhance evaluation of classification
guidelines, as well as individual athlete performance.

primary predictors of aggressive tendencies for both skill levels included

expenditure (TEE) in elite basketball players. At the beginning of the pre-season
and at the final of the competitive period, measures of total and regional FM, FFM,
lean soft tissue (LST), and bone mineral estimated by DXA and REE by indirect
calorimetry were obtained in eight males and nine females of the Portuguese
basketball team (16-17 years). TEE was assessed by doubly labeled water. Handgrip
and a vertical-jumping were used to assess strength and power. Changes were
expressed as a percentage from the baseline values. Resting energy expenditure and
TEE increased by 13.2 ± 12.6 and 13.3 ± 12.7% (p < 0.01), respectively. Increases in
FFM (3.6 ± 2.2%) and reductions in relative FM (-4.0 ± 6.6%) were observed (p <
0.01). The strength and power increased by 14.4 ± 9.9 and 9.8 ± 10.6%, respectively
(p < 0.001). Alone, FFM and arms LST differences explained 25 and 23% of the total
variance in REE alteration. These variables remained associated after adjusting for
gender and baseline values (β = 0.536, p = 0.042; and β = 2.023, p = 0.016,
respectively). Over the season, the REE increase was explained by changes in FFM.
The increase in REE along with the strength and power improvement may suggest that a
qualitative change in the metabolic active tissues occurred. Furthermore, these
findings highlight the regional LST contribution, specifically located at the upper
limbs, as a key component for the higher REE occurred over the season in junior
basketball players.

9111454	Shoulder rotator torque and wheelchair dependence differences of National Wheelchair	"OBJECTIVE: Shoulder rotator muscle imbalances can contribute to subacromial impingement. The forces and movement patterns of wheelchair locomotion may
contribute to these imbalances. This study attempted to determine whether National
Wheelchair Basketball Association players of differing classifications had
significant differences (p < or = .05) in concentric isokinetic peak shoulder
rotator torque and torque ratios, and wheelchair locomotion dependence. DESIGN:
Fifty-seven (class 1 = 12, class 2 = 24, class 3 = 21) of 117 total tournament
participants (class 1 = 25, class 2 = 49, class 3 = 43) served as the convenience
sample of volunteers for the survey portion, and 33 of these subjects (class 1 = 11,
class 2 = 12, class 3 = 10) also entered the isokinetic portion of this study.
SETTING: National wheelchair basketball tournament. RESULTS: Class 1 and 2 players
had greater wheelchair dependence than class 3 players (p < or = .05). Peak torque
or torque ratios generally did not differ among player classifications or with other
populations. Class 1 players had weaker nondominant shoulder external rotator torque
production at 60 degrees/sec (p < or = .03) compared with other classes and at 180
degrees/sec compared with class 3 players (p = .02), suggesting an inability to
develop the ""attenuation of dominance"" noted among other groups. Diminished
torque-producing capacity at 60 degrees/sec related to greater wheelchair dependence
among class 1 players (p = .034). CONCLUSIONS: Class 1 players failed to demonstrate
the acquired shoulder external rotator torque symmetry evident among class 2 and 3
players (with specific weakness of the nondominant shoulder external rotators). This
torque symmetry difference was related to their greater dependence on wheelchair
locomotion.

players. Skilled (n=12) and unskilled (n=11) basketball players were asked to bounce
a basketball every 700 msec. in as temporally stable and spatially accurate a manner
as possible, while keeping their eyes fixed straight ahead. Spatial analyses
revealed a lower variability of the ball bouncing point and less deviation from a
target point in the performance of skilled players compared to unskilled players.
Temporal analyses revealed no significant difference in variability of the
interbounce interval in skilled versus unskilled players. However, skilled players
had longer and more consistent contact time between hand and ball compared to the
unskilled players. These results suggest that longer and more consistent hand
contact with the ball play an important role in spatial control of basketball
bouncing position.

were carried out 3 times weekly; each session consisted of 48 contractions. Testing
was carried out before and after the electromyostimulation training program (week 4)
and once more after 4 weeks of normal basketball training (week 8). At week 4,
isokinetic strength increased significantly (p < 0.05) at eccentric and high
concentric velocities (between 180 and 360 x s(-1)); this was not the case for low
concentric velocities (60 and 120 degrees x s(-1)). Electromyostimulation training
increased also isometric strength at the two angles adjacent to the training angle
(p < 0.01). Squat jump increased significantly by 14% at week 4 (p < 0.01), whereas
counter movement-jump showed no change. At week 8, gains in isokinetic, isometric
strength and squat-jump performance were maintained and the counter movement jump
performance increased significantly by 17% (p<0.01). Electromyostimulation as part

20664369	The effects of 4 weeks of jump training on landing knee valgus and crossover hop	"Female basketball players would appear particularly prone to knee injuries. These injuries have been associated with the nature of the sport, but more specifically
with the particular movement strategies adopted. A valgus or abducted position of
the knee on landing has been reported to be associated with a number of different
knee injuries. Jump-training programs have been reported to improve both landing
knee valgus and functional performance. The majority of the jump-training programs
have been of 6 weeks' duration, 3 sessions per week often lasting up to 1 hour. For
most sports coaches, team conditioners, and athletes, this duration and program
length is not acceptable. The aim of this study was to assess if an abridged
jump-training program could have similar effects to those previously reported.
Fifteen female basketball players had their knee valgus angles assessed during 2
landing tasks, drop jump landing, and when undertaking a jump shot and along with
crossover hop distance before and after a progressive jump-training program. The
jump-training program lasted 4 weeks, 3 times per week, each session lasting 15
minutes. After training, crossover hop distance showed an average percentage
improvement on distance jumped of 73.6% (p = 0.001); the drop jump knee valgus angle
in the left leg on average was reduced by 9.8° (p = 0.002), right leg reduced by
12.3° (p = 0.0001); during the jump shot, the knee valgus angle in the left leg

penetration, efficiency of screening, drawing fouls and three-point plays, and free
throws. The research results could be usefully applied by the basketball

relationship between talent and performance: Participants expected that more talent
improves performance and that this relationship never turns negative. However,
building off research on status conflicts, we predicted that talent facilitates
performance-but only up to a point, after which the benefits of more talent decrease
and eventually become detrimental as intrateam coordination suffers. We also
predicted that the level of task interdependence is a key determinant of when more
talent is detrimental rather than beneficial. Three archival studies revealed that
the too-much-talent effect emerged when team members were interdependent (football
and basketball) but not independent (baseball). Our basketball analysis also
established the mediating role of team coordination. When teams need to come
together, more talent can tear them apart.

24580142	Secular trend: morphology and performance.	"In a context of morphological expansion of the general population, how do athletes follow such a pattern of anthropometric growth? Is there any relation to
performance? Biometric data including mass, height, body mass index (BMI) and age
were collected for 50,376 American athletes representing 249,336 annual performers
playing in professional baseball, football, ice hockey and basketball. Distributions
by mass in National Football League (NFL) players are described by periods. Field
goals have been studied in relation to players' height in the National Basketball
Association (NBA). Between 1871 and 2011, athletes from the four sports have
increased significantly in mass, height and BMI, following a multi-exponential
function series. Consequently, biometric differences between athletes and the
general population are increasing gradually. Changes in the mass distribution within
the NFL show the emergence of a biometrical specificity in relation to the field
position. At the professional level, performance remains structured around precise
biometric values. In the NBA, a height-attractor at 201.3 ± 6.3 cm for the best
scorers is invariant, regardless of the level of play. These results suggest that
laws of growth and biometrics drive high-level sport and organise performance around
the specific constraint of each field position. Discrepancies between some mass and
height developments question the (disproportionate) large mass increase (relative to
the height increase) during the 1980s and 1990s.

extensions at 60 and 300 degrees .s(-1) on a calibrated Biodex System 3 dynamometer.
After the initial isokinetic testing, the dominant leg extensors were stretched
using 1 unassisted and 3 assisted static stretching exercises. The poststretching
isokinetic assessments were repeated at 5, 15, 30, and 45 minutes after the static
stretching (post-5, post-15, post-30, and post-45). PT (N.m) and MP (W) were

changes in PT (p = 0.161) or MP (p = 0.088) from pre- to poststretching for any of
the testing intervals (post-5, post-15, post-30, and post-45). These findings
indicated that the static stretching had no impact on PT or MP during maximal,
voluntary concentric isokinetic muscle actions in collegiate women's basketball
players. In conjunction with previous studies, these findings suggested that trained
athletes may be less susceptible to the stretching-induced force deficit than
untrained, nonathletes.

27831718	Expert players accurately detect an opponent's movement intentions through sound	"Sounds offer a rich source of information about events taking place in our physical and social environment. However, outside the domains of speech and music, little is
known about whether humans can recognize and act upon the intentions of another
agent's actions detected through auditory information alone. In this study we
assessed whether intention can be inferred from the sound an action makes, and in
turn, whether this information can be used to prospectively guide movement. In 2
experiments experienced and novice basketball players had to virtually intercept an
attacker by listening to audio recordings of that player's movements. In the first
experiment participants had to move a slider, while in the second one their body, to
block the perceived passage of the attacker as they would in a real basketball game.
Combinations of deceptive and nondeceptive movements were used to see if novice
and/or experienced listeners could perceive the attacker's intentions through sound
alone. We showed that basketball players were able to more accurately predict final
running direction compared to nonplayers, particularly in the second experiment when
the interceptive action was more basketball specific. We suggest that athletes
present better action anticipation by being able to pick up and use the relevant
kinematic features of deceptive movement from event-related sounds alone. This
result suggests that action intention can be perceived through the sound a movement
makes and that the ability to determine another person's action intention from the
information conveyed through sound is honed through practice. (PsycINFO Database

additional benefits by comparison with traditional MI practice. However, the
efficacy of motor imagery in different states of physical fatigue remains largely
unknown, especially as imagery accuracy may be hampered by the physical fatigue
states elicited by training. We investigated the effect of static motor imagery
(sMI) and dMI on free-throw accuracy in 10 high-level basketball athletes, both in a
non-fatigued state (Experiment 1) and immediately after an incremental running test
completed until exhaustion (20 m shuttle run-test-Experiment 2). We collected
perceived exhaustion and heart rate to quantify the subjective experience of fatigue
and energy expenditure. We found that dMI brought better shooting performance than
sMI, except when athletes were physically exhausted. These findings shed light on
the conditions eliciting optimal use of sMI and dMI. In particular, considering that
the current physical state affects body representation, performing dMI under fatigue
may result in mismatches between actual and predicted body states.

shooting or throwing movements. Eye movement data indirectly support this claim for
stationary tasks. Using the basketball jump shot as experimental task we
investigated whether in dynamic tasks in which the target can be seen until ball
release, continuous, instead of preprogrammed, motor control is possible. We tested
this with the temporal occlusion paradigm: 10 expert shooters took shots under four
viewing conditions, namely, no vision, full vision, early vision (vision occluded
during the final +/-350 ms before ball release), and late vision (vision occluded
until these final +/-350 ms). Late-vision shooting appeared to be as good as
shooting with full vision while early-vision performance was severely impaired. The
results imply that the final shooting movements were controlled by continuous
detection and use of visual information until ball release. The data further suggest
that visual and movement control of aiming at a far target develop in close
correspondence with the style of execution.

the ball from a lower height, with greater velocity and release angle. They
demonstrated a smaller shoulder flexion angle at release and a greater maximum
velocity at the shoulder and elbow. The clean shots of Classes 1 and 2 demanded
greater accuracy with respect to release velocity and angle, yet the resulting ball
trajectory displayed a greater margin for error than the shots observed in the upper
classes. However, based on overall shooting percentage, the upper classes did not
appear to take advantage of the predicted benefits provided by a higher ball release

performed a stationary basketball dribble task at a mirror box in a standing
position and received either MVF or direct feedback. After four training days using
only the right hand, performance of both hands improved from pre- to posttest
measurements. Only the left hand (untrained) performance of the experienced
participants receiving MVF was more pronounced than for the control group. This
indicates that intermanual motor transfer can be improved by MVF in a sport-specific
task. However, this effect cannot be generalized to motor learning per se since it
is modulated by individuals' skill level, a factor that might be considered in
mirror therapy research.

19561174	Effects of sports injury prevention training on the biomechanical risk factors of	"BACKGROUND: Female athletes have a higher risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury than their male counterparts who play at similar levels in sports involving pivoting
and landing. HYPOTHESIS: The competitive female basketball players who participated
in a sports injury prevention training program would show better muscle strength and
flexibility and improved biomechanical properties associated with anterior cruciate
ligament injury than during the pretraining period and than posttraining parameters
in a control group. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: A total of
22 high school female basketball players were recruited and randomly divided into 2
groups (the experimental group and the control group, 11 participants each). The
experimental group was instructed in the 6 parts of the sports injury prevention
training program and performed it during the first 20 minutes of team practice for
the next 8 weeks, while the control group performed their regular training program.
Both groups were tested with a rebound-jump task before and after the 8-week period.
A total of 21 reflective markers were placed in preassigned positions. In this
controlled laboratory study, a 2-way analysis of variance (2 x 2) experimental
design was used for the statistical analysis (P < .05) using the experimental group
and a testing session as within and between factors, respectively. Post hoc tests
with Sidak correction were used when significant factor effects and/or interactions
were observed. RESULTS: A comparison of the experimental group's pretraining and
posttraining results identified training effects on all strength parameters (P =
.004 to .043) and on knee flexion, which reflects increased flexibility (P = .022).
The experimental group showed higher knee flexion angles (P = .024), greater
interknee distances (P = .004), lower hamstring-quadriceps ratios (P = .023), and
lower maximum knee extension torques (P = .043) after training. In the control
group, no statistical differences were observed between pretraining and posttraining
findings (P = .084 to .873). At pretraining, no significant differences were
observed between the 2 groups for any parameter (P = .067 to .784). However, a
comparison of the 2 groups after training revealed that the experimental group had
significantly higher knee flexion angles (P = .023), greater knee distances (P =
.005), lower hamstring-quadriceps ratios (P = .021), lower maximum knee extension
torques (P = .124), and higher maximum knee abduction torques P (= .043) than the
control group. CONCLUSION: The sports injury prevention training program improved
the strength and flexibility of the competitive female basketball players tested and
biomechanical properties associated with anterior cruciate ligament injury as
compared with pretraining parameters and with posttraining parameters in the control
group. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This injury prevention program could potentially modify
the flexibility, strength, and biomechanical properties associated with ACL injury
and lower the athlete's risk for injury.

10727077	Nutrition antioxidant status and oxidative stress in professional basketball	"Professional basketball players of the First Spanish League (ACB) are highly trained athletes performing high training loads and competition sessions. As intense
physical activity has been suggested to increase free radical production, we
examined the effects of a vitamin antioxidant mixture on the degree of oxidative
stress in these athletes. Subjects received either 600 mg alpha-tocopherol, 1,000 mg
vitamin C and 32 mg beta-carotene, or a placebo over 32 days during a regular
competition season. Plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C,
beta-carotene, retinol, lipoperoxides (LPO), and the total antioxidant status (TAS)
were analysed before and after treatment. Lipoperoxide plasma levels decreased
significantly (p < 0.05) in the vitamin antioxidant supplemented group. The LPO/TAS
ratio decreased about 15.3% in this group indicating a reduction in oxidative
stress. Vitamin C dropped dramatically (p < 0.03, mean 15.4 micromol/L) in the
placebo group leading to a marginal plasma vitamin C concentration (from 11 to less
than 28 micromol/L). The results of this study suggest that the administered vitamin
antioxidant mixture decreases oxidative stress and avoids the development of a
marginal vitamin C status in professional basketball player during habitual
training.

hurt her middle finger while playing basketball. A lateral radiograph revealed volar
and dorsal fractures of the middle phalanx. She underwent external immobilization of
the PIPJ in 30 degrees of flexion with a splint for 3 weeks. The fractures healed 7
weeks after the injury with neither tenderness nor limitation of range of motion.
The second case was a 16-year-old boy. He injured his index finger while playing
basketball, and underwent immobilization of the PIPJ for 3 weeks. At 10 weeks after
the injury, the dorsal fracture was almost healed, but the displacement of the volar

the volar fragment remained in a site of nonunion. However, there was neither
residual deformity nor restriction of movement.

16780260	[The risk of mitral pathology in marphanoid female basketball players].	"Recently much research has been done focusing on the problem of athlete's heart as a physiological phenomenon as well as a cause of morbidity or even mortality. The
question rises whether pathology discovered in some athletes was primary or
developed after professional excessive training program. THE AIM: We studied a group
of young female athletes (basketball players) to test the hypothesis that marfanoid
habitus, favorable in this sport, could bear predisposition for pathology of the
heart. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 38 young female athletes, mean age 15 (+/-
1.8) years, participants of special education program for talented sportsmen from
all over Poland. Athletes were included on the basis of outstanding results and
participating at least one year in professional basketball. Complete
echocardiographic examination was performed according to protocol which included
M-mode, 2D and color Doppler. Systolic and diastolic morphologic and functional
parameters were assessed and compared to normal values related to the age. RESULTS:
Stature of studied athletes exceeded the 95 percentile. There were no significant
differences in morphological parameters of the heart. Mitral incompetence (at least
II grade) was a common finding in this group (37%). In the group exhibiting
marphanoid habitus, mitral incompetence was present in all except one case (89%).
CONCLUSIONS: Tall stature being favorable in basketball promotes athletes with
marphanoid habitus which have higher risk of mitral incompetence.

24531435	Differences in lower-body stiffness between levels of netball competition.	"There are many notable differences in physical and skill attributes between competition levels, especially in team sports. Stiffness is an important mechanical
factor to measure when considering athletic performance and injury incidence. Active
vertical stiffness (K(vert)) during hopping and passive stiffness during lying and
standing were measured during the preseason period for 46 female netballers (24.0 ±
3.7 years, 72.2 ± 7.6 kg, 175.2 ± 6.7 cm). Participants were classified as elite,
sub-elite, representative or recreational based on their current level of
competition. A 1-way analysis of variance revealed that elite players possessed
significantly higher K(vert) than recreational players (p = 0.018). Large effect
sizes (ES) suggested that elite players also possessed higher K(vert) than sub-elite
(d = 1.11) and representative (d = 1.11) players. A number of large and moderate ES
were also present when comparing the passive stiffness of elite players to their
lower-ranked counterparts. The results of this study suggest that elite players
possess higher levels of active stiffness when compared with their lower-ranked
counterparts. The differences in stiffness levels may contribute to a player's
ability to physically perform at an elite level and also provide one explanation
into elevated rates of injury at higher levels of competition.

27015636	The Advantage of Playing Home in NBA: Microscopic, Team-Specific and Evolving	"The idea that the success rate of a team increases when playing home is broadly accepted and documented for a wide variety of sports. Investigations on the
so-called ""home advantage phenomenon"" date back to the 70's and ever since has
attracted the attention of scholars and sport enthusiasts. These studies have been
mainly focused on identifying the phenomenon and trying to correlate it with
external factors such as crowd noise and referee bias. Much less is known about the
effects of home advantage in the ""microscopic"" dynamics of the game (within the
game) or possible team-specific and evolving features of this phenomenon. Here we
present a detailed study of these previous features in the National Basketball
Association (NBA). By analyzing play-by-play events of more than sixteen thousand
games that span thirteen NBA seasons, we have found that home advantage affects the
microscopic dynamics of the game by increasing the scoring rates and decreasing the
time intervals between scores of teams playing home. We verified that these two
features are different among the NBA teams, for instance, the scoring rate of the
Cleveland Cavaliers team is increased ≈0.16 points per minute (on average the
seasons 2004-05 to 2013-14) when playing home, whereas for the New Jersey Nets (now
the Brooklyn Nets) this rate increases in only ≈0.04 points per minute. We further
observed that these microscopic features have evolved over time in a non-trivial
manner when analyzing the results team-by-team. However, after averaging over all
teams some regularities emerge; in particular, we noticed that the average
differences in the scoring rates and in the characteristic times (related to the
time intervals between scores) have slightly decreased over time, suggesting a
weakening of the phenomenon. This study thus adds evidence of the home advantage
phenomenon and contributes to a deeper understanding of this effect over the course
of games.

data show that team physicians are not comfortable either treating athletes with
bleeding disorders or allowing them to participate in contact sports. Much of the
literature historically has recommended against allowing athletes with bleeding
disorders to play sports at all and certainly against playing contact sports.
Hemophilia treatment can now include prophylactic injections of recombinant factor
VIII to prevent bleeding episodes. Modern treatments hold the promise of allowing
athletes with hemophilia to participate in contact sports. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:
Mild, moderate, or severe hemophilia; von Willebrand disease; other factor
deficiencies. TREATMENT:  A treatment protocol was developed that included
prophylactic factor VIII injections on a regular basis and when the athlete was
injured. UNIQUENESS:  This is the first published case report of an athlete with
known hemophilia being successfully treated and participating in National Collegiate
Athletic Association collegiate basketball for 2 full seasons. CONCLUSIONS:  Sports
medicine teams can successfully manage an athlete with hemophilia playing a contact

Abusive leadership scores were derived from ratings by two independent raters'

data were derived from objective sources. Data were obtained from players (N = 693)
and coaches (N = 57) involved in the National Basketball Association (NBA) between
the 2000-2001 and 2005-2006 seasons. Controlling for tenure, salary, team winning
percentage, and absence due to injuries, multilevel modeling showed that exposure to
abusive leadership influenced both the trajectory of psychological aggression and
task performance over players' careers. These findings suggest that the effects of
abusive leadership extend far longer than currently acknowledged, thus furthering
our understanding of the nature and effects of abusive leadership.

23649796	The expert advantage in dynamic pattern recall persists across both attended and	"We examined how differences in attention influence how expert and novice basketball players encode into memory the specific structural information contained within
patterns of play from their sport. Our participants were primed during a typical
recall task to focus attention on either attacking or defending player formations
before being asked to recall the attended or unattended portion of the pattern.
Adherence to the instructional set was confirmed through an analysis of gaze
distributions. Recall performance was superior for the experts relative to the
novices across both the attended and unattended attacking and defensive pattern
structures. Expert recall of attacker positions was unchanged with and without
attention, whereas recall accuracy for the positions of defenders diminished without
attention, as did the novices' recall of both attack and defense formations. The
findings suggest that experienced performers are better than novices at encoding the
elements from a complex and dynamic pattern in the absence of focused attention,
with this advantage being especially evident in relation to the recall of attacking
structure. Some revision of long-term memory theories of expertise will be necessary
to accommodate these findings.

12137300	Pragmatic validity of the combined model of expert system for assessment and	"The authors presumed that it was possible to replace certain criteria of the expert system aimed at evaluating actual quality of basketball players, proposed by Trninić
et al., with the corresponding indicators of situation-related efficiency (official
statistics of the game). Hence, the aim of this study is to verify the potential of
establishing such a combined model of expert system that would consist of both the
evaluation criteria and certain number of objectively measurable aspects of actual
quality (player's partial performance or playing efficiency) and to determine its
pragmatic validity. To achieve the aim the sample comprised of 60 basketball players
that were competing in the Croatian First Division League in the 1998/99 season was
tested. The sample and their quality of play was described by the two different
types of data: 1) the 13 situation-related efficiency data (FIBA statistics of the
game) utilized to objectively assess performance or playing effectiveness of
players, collected at 132 games played by 12 teams, and 2) the evaluation data,
subjectively assessing actual quality of players, i.e. their perceived overall
performance, collected at the end of the season from the 10 basketball trainers. On
the basis of relatively high correlations within the 7 pairs of mutually equivalent
variables (from 0.63 to 0.84) and the extremely high correlation (0.97) obtained
between the perceived overall performance (actual quality), subjectively assessed
with respect to the 19 criteria of the original expert evaluation system, and the
overall performance (actual quality) assessed by the combined model (where the 8
evaluation criteria had been replaced by the 7 corresponding indicators ofplaying
efficiency), it is feasible to consider the combined model of expert system as an
acceptable tool for more objective and economical assessment of actual quality of
basketball players.

limited. OBJECTIVE: To identify barriers to compliance with a home-based injury
prevention program in rural Wisconsin female high school basketball players. DESIGN:
Cross-sectional study including participants from 9 rural Wisconsin high schools.
Participants were instructed in appropriate exercise form and DVD use in a
group-based format. Participants were instructed to perform the home-based program 3
times per week for 8 weeks. Participants then completed a survey regarding their
program compliance. SETTING: Exercise instruction and surveys were completed in the
participant's high school gymnasium. PARTICIPANTS: Female students in grades 9-12,
who intended to play basketball, were invited to participate. Of the 175 eligible
students, 66 enrolled in the study. INTERVENTION: The intervention consisted of a
DVD-based injury prevention program. MAIN OUTCOME: Our hypothesis--that compliance
with a home-based injury prevention program would be low--was established prior to
study commencement. Outcome measures consisted of self-reported responses by
participants. Statistics are descriptive. RESULTS: Follow-up surveys were completed
by 27 of 66 participants, with 50% reporting performing the injury prevention
program 0-3 times per week. The reasons for low compliance included ""I did not have
time to do the program,"" followed by ""I forgot to do the program."" CONCLUSIONS AND
RELEVANCE: Wisconsin female high school basketball players demonstrated very low

teammates as a means of achieving group objectives. We find that despite the
seemingly strong group incentive to win the NBA title, cooperative play actually
diminishes during playoff games, negatively affecting team performance. Thus team
cooperation decreases in the very high stakes contexts in which it is most important
to perform well together. Highlighting the mixed incentives that underlie selfish
play, personal scoring is rewarded with more lucrative future contracts, whereas
assisting teammates to score is associated with reduced pay due to lost
opportunities for personal scoring. A combination of misaligned incentives and
psychological biases in performance evaluation bring out the ""I"" in ""team"" when

(p < 0.05). CE developed greater positive mechanical impulse than GU in all jump
types (p < 0.05) and achieved higher maximal instantaneous power than GU and FW in
the SJ and ABK (p < 0.05). Centers had more plasma testosterone than guards (p <
0.05). All groups a similar relative VO2max. CONCLUSION: Center position was
associated to lower adiposity and higher jumping performance than playing as guards.
All playing positions induced a similar effect on aerobic power.

24404807	Perceived distributed effort in team ball sports.	"In this study, we explored the multifaceted concept of perceived mental and physical effort in team sport contexts where athletes must invest individual and shared
efforts to reach a common goal. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a
convenience sample of 15 Catalan professional coaches (3 women and 12 men, 3 each
from the following sports: volleyball, basketball, handball, soccer, and water polo)
to gain their views of three perceived effort-related dimensions: physical,
psychological, and tactical. From a theoretical thematic analysis, it was found that
the perception of effort is closely related to how effort is distributed within the
team. Moreover, coaches viewed physical effort in relation to the frequency and
intensity of the players' involvement in the game. They identified psychological
effort in situations where players pay attention to proper cues, and manage emotions
under difficult circumstances. Tactical effort addressed the decision-making process
of players and how they fulfilled their roles while taking into account the actions
of their teammates and opponents. Based on these findings, a model of perceived
distributed effort was developed, which delineates the elements that compose each of
the aforementioned dimensions. Implications of perceived distributed effort in team
coordination and shared mental models are discussed.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the applicability of a 3-month jump-landing training program
in basketball players, using the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption,
implementation, and maintenance) framework. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: National and regional basketball teams. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS:
Twenty-four teams of the second highest national division and regional basketball
divisions in Flanders, Belgium, were randomly assigned (1:1) to a control group and
intervention group. A total of 243 athletes (control group = 129, intervention group
= 114), ages 15 to 41 years, volunteered. INTERVENTION(S): All exercises in the
intervention program followed a progressive development, emphasizing lower extremity
alignment during jump-landing activities. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The results of
the process evaluation of the intervention program were based on the 5 dimensions of
the RE-AIM framework. The injury incidence density, hazard ratios, and 95%
confidence intervals were determined. RESULTS: The participation rate of the total
sample was 100% (reach). The hazard ratio was different between the intervention
group and the control group (0.40 [95% confidence interval = 0.16, 0.99];
effectiveness). Of the 12 teams in the intervention group, 8 teams (66.7%) agreed to
participate in the study (adoption). Eight of the participating coaches (66.7%) felt
positively about the intervention program and stated that they had implemented the
training sessions of the program as intended (implementation). All coaches except 1
(87.5%) intended to continue the intervention program the next season (maintenance).
CONCLUSIONS: Compliance of the coaches in this coach-supervised jump-landing
training program was high. In addition, the program was effective in preventing
lower extremity injuries.

twin resources model. Cognitive and somatic anxiety were manipulated using a 'time
to event' paradigm. The aspects of performance were a short-term memory task (letter
span) and a low memory demand, motoric-sustained information transfer task (rebound
shooting). Hypotheses based on the different models were formulated and subsequently
tested using analysis of variance and polynomial regression analysis. The results
indicated significant (P < 0.01) linear relationships with negative slopes between
cognitive anxiety and letter span, and between somatic anxiety and letter span;
while significant (P < 0.01) linear relationships with positive slopes were recorded
between cognitive anxiety and rebound shooting, and between somatic anxiety and
rebound shooting. The analysis of variance results were in agreement with a positive
effect (P < 0.05) for cognitive anxiety upon rebound shooting, and a negative effect
which approached significance (P < 0.07) for somatic anxiety upon letter span. The
results were interpreted as offering partial support for Eysenck's (1979)
theoretical model, although further examination of multidimensional anxiety effects
via the two models is warranted.

24582876	Differences in adolescent relationship abuse perpetration and gender-inequitable	"PURPOSE: School-based athletic programs remain an important context for violence prevention efforts although a better understanding of how gender attitudes and abuse
perpetration differ among athletes is needed. METHODS: We analyzed baseline survey
data from the ""Coaching Boys into Men"" study-a school-based cluster-randomized trial
in 16 high schools in Northern California. We describe relationships among
gender-inequitable attitudes, sport type, and recent adolescent relationship abuse
perpetration among a sample of male athletes (n = 1,648). RESULTS:
Gender-inequitable attitudes (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 3.26; 95% confidence
interval (CI), 2.56, 4.15), participation in both high school football and
basketball (AOR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.37, 3.18), and participation in football only (AOR,
1.50; 95% CI, 1.02, 2.22) emerged as independently associated with recent ARA
perpetration. CONCLUSIONS: Findings warrant targeted violence prevention efforts
among male high school athletes that incorporate discussions of gender attitudes and
healthy relationships, especially among sports teams at greater risk of adolescent
relationship abuse perpetration.

24665811	Influence of a health-related physical fitness model on students' physical activity,	"This study was designed to explore the effects of a health-related physical fitness physical education model on students' physical activity, perceived competence, and
enjoyment. 61 students (25 boys, 36 girls; M age = 12.6 yr., SD = 0.6) were assigned
to two groups (health-related physical fitness physical education group, and
traditional physical education group), and participated in one 50-min. weekly
basketball class for 6 wk. Students' in-class physical activity was assessed using
NL-1000 pedometers. The physical subscale of the Perceived Competence Scale for
Children was employed to assess perceived competence, and children's enjoyment was
measured using the Sport Enjoyment Scale. The findings suggest that students in the
intervention group increased their perceived competence, enjoyment, and physical
activity over a 6-wk. intervention, while the comparison group simply increased
physical activity over time. Children in the intervention group had significantly
greater enjoyment.

24380468	Prioritizing school intramural and interscholastic programs based on observed	"PURPOSE: To examine which school sports engage children in more physical activity. DESIGN: Observational, cross-sectional study examining differences between
intramural (IM) and interscholastic (IS) sports. SETTING: Athletic facilities at two
schools with IM sports and two schools with IS sports in Wake County, North
Carolina. SUBJECTS: Middle-school children (N = 6735). MEASURES: Percentage of
children observed in sedentary, moderate, and vigorous activity assessed by the
System for Observation Play and Leisure Among Youth (SOPLAY). Energy expenditure and
physical activity intensity were also estimated by using MET values. ANALYSIS:
T-tests; generalized linear model using cumulative logit link function. RESULTS: IM
sports had higher MET values than IS sports (t = -3.69, p < .001), and IM sports
ranked in four of the top five sports in terms of average MET values. Regression
models found a significant interaction between school sport delivery model and
gender, with boys significantly less physically active in IS programs than boys in
IM programs (B = -.447, p < .001) but more physically active (B = .359, p <.001)
than girls in IM sports. CONCLUSION: Regardless of sport type, IM sports generated
more physical activity than IS sports among boys but not girls. Soccer, basketball,
and track, regardless of school delivery approach, provide the highest physical
activity levels. Results suggest that school administrators consider reassessing
their programs to more efficiently use diminishing resources to increase students'
physical activity levels.

27599187	Fluctuations of the experience of togetherness within the team over time:	"Based on a diagnosis action research design, the present study assessed the fluctuations of the team experience of togetherness. Reported experiences of 12
basketball team members playing in the under-18 years old national championship were
studied during a four-month training and competitive period. Time series analysis
(Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average procedures) served to describe temporal
properties of the way in which the fluctuations of task-cohesion and shared
understanding were step-by-step experienced over time, respectively. Correlations,
running-correlations and cross-lagged correlations were used to describe the
temporal links that governed the relationships between both phenomena. The results
indicated that the task-cohesion dimensions differed mainly for shared understanding
dynamics in that their time fluctuations were not embedded in external events, and
that the variations in shared understanding tend to precede 'individual attractions
to the task' variations with seven team practical sessions. This study argues for
further investigation of how 'togetherness' is experienced alternatively as a
feeling of cohesion or shared understanding. Practitioner Summary: The present
action research study investigated the experience that the team members have to
share information during practice, and the subsequent benefices on team cohesion.
Results call for specific interventions that make team members accept the
fluctuating nature of team phenomena, to help them maintaining their daily efforts.

22250669	More than just the mean: moving to a dynamic view of performance-based compensation.	"Compensation decisions have important consequences for employees and organizations and affect factors such as retention, motivation, and recruitment. Past research has
primarily focused on mean performance as a predictor of compensation, promoting the
implicit assumption that alternative aspects of dynamic performance are not
relevant. To address this gap in the literature, we examined the influence of
dynamic performance characteristics on compensation decisions in the National
Basketball Association (NBA). We predicted that, in addition to performance mean,
performance trend and variability would also affect compensation decisions. Results
revealed that performance mean and trend, but not variability, were significantly
and positively related to changes in compensation levels of NBA players. Moreover,
trend (but not mean or variability) predicted compensation when controlling for
future performance, suggesting that organizations overweighted trend in their
compensation decisions. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

22643146	Peak power prediction in junior basketballers: comparing linear and allometric	"Equations, commonly used to predict peak power from jump height, have relied on linear additive models that are biologically unsound beyond the range of
observations because of high negative intercept values. This study explored the
utility of allometric multiplicative modeling to better predict peak power in
adolescent basketball players. Seventy-seven elite junior basketball players (62
adolescent boys, 15 adolescent girls, age = 16.8 ± 0.8 years) performed 3 counter
movement jumps (CMJs) on a force platform. Both linear and multiplicative models
were then used to determine their efficacy. Four previously published linear
equations were significantly associated with actual peak power (all p < 0.01),
although here were significant differences between actual and estimated peak power
using the SJ and CMJ equations by Sayers (both p < 0.001). Allometric modeling was
used to determine an alternative biologically sound equation which was more strongly
associated with (r = 0.886, p < 0.001), and not significantly different to (p >
0.05), actual peak power and predicted 77.9% of the variance in actual peak power
(adjusted R = 0.779, p < 0.001). Exponents close to 1 for body mass and CMJ height
indicated that peak power could also be determined from the product of body mass and
CMJ height. This equation was significantly associated (r = 0.871, p < 0.001) with,
and not significantly different to, actual peak power (adjusted R = 0.756, p > 0.05)
and offered a more accurate estimation of peak power than previously validated
linear additive models examined in this study. The allometric model determined from
this study or the multiplicative model (body mass × CMJ height) provides
biologically sound models to accurately estimate peak power in elite adolescent
basketballers that are more accurate than equations based on linear additive models.

25389640	Generic and sport-specific reactive agility tests assess different qualities in	"BACKGROUND: Comparisons between reactive agility tests incorporating generic and sport-specific stimuli have been performed only in field-based team sports. The aim
of this study was to compare generic (light-based) and sport-specific (live
opponent) reactive agility tests in court-based team sport athletes. METHODS: Twelve
semi-professional male basketball players (age: 25.9±6.7 yr; stature: 188.9±7.9 cm;
body mass: 97.4±16.1 kg; predicted maximal oxygen uptake: 49.5±5.3 mL/kg 7 min)
completed multiple trials of a Reactive Agility Test containing light-based
(RAT-Light) and opponent-based stimuli (RAT-Opponent). Multiple outcome measures
were collected during the RAT-Light (agility time and total time) and RAT-Opponent
(decision time and total time). RESULTS: Mean performance times during the RAT-Light
(2.233±0.224 s) were significantly (P<0.001) slower than during the RAT-Opponent
(1.726±0.178 s). Further, a small relationship was observed between RAT-Light
agility time and RAT-Opponent decision time (r10=0.20), while a trivial relationship
was apparent between total performance times across tests (r10=0.02). Low
commonality was observed between comparable measures across tests (R2=0-4%).
CONCLUSIONS: Reactive agility tests containing light-based and live opponent stimuli
appear to measure different qualities in court-based team sport athletes.
Court-based team sport coaches and conditioning professionals should not use generic
and sport-specific reactive agility tests interchangeably during athlete
assessments.

24164634	Specificity of learning a sport skill to the visual condition of acquisition.	"The authors' main purpose was to determine whether learning of a real-world sport skill (basketball free throws) is specific to the sources of afferent visual
information available during practice. Twenty-eight male high school students
(inexperienced in the experimental task) were randomly assigned to a full vision or
target only vision group. Participants trained under full vision or target only
condition for 15 sessions. Following training, in immediate tests, they were
examined under full vision and then under target only conditions. Ten days later, in
delayed tests, they performed the task under full vision and then under target only
conditions. Results showed both groups performed the task similarly across the
experimental period. Interestingly, it was found that immediate and delayed
retention performance is specific to the training visual context. The groups'
performances dropped significantly when we tested them at a visual condition that
differed from what they had experienced while learning the task. Performance of the
task seemed to have integrated with the visual information available during the task
acquisition. These findings provide evidence for the specificity of practice
hypothesis in the field of motor learning and control.

11361327	Relationship between team assists and win-loss record in The National Basketball	"Using research methodology for analysis of secondary data, statistical data for five National Basketball Association (NBA) seasons (1993-1994 to 1997-1998) were examined
to test for a relationship between team assists (a behavioral measure of teamwork)
and win-loss record. Rank-difference correlation indicated a significant
relationship between the two variables, the coefficients ranging from .42 to .71.
Team assist totals produced higher correlations with win-loss record than assist
totals for the five players receiving the most playing time (""the starters""). A
comparison of ""assisted team points"" and ""unassisted team points"" in relationship to
win-loss record favored the former and strongly suggested that how a basketball team
scores points is more important than the number of points it scores. These findings
provide circumstantial support for the popular dictum in competitive team sports
that ""Teamwork Means Success-Work Together, Win Together.""

26049672	Mediators effecting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and inactivity for girls	"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to test whether coaches' physical activity levels, contextual variables, and coaches' behavioural variables mediated
the effect of an intervention on female basketball players' moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity (MVPA) and inactivity in an organised youth sport (OYS) setting.
DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial METHODS: Data for the current study were derived
from a two-armed, parallel-group randomised controlled trial. This study ran over
the course of a 5-day OYS basketball program in 2 sports centres in Sydney,
Australia. A convenience sample of 76 female players and 8 coaches were recruited.
Coaches allocated to the intervention condition attended 2 coach education sessions,
where strategies to increase MVPA and decrease inactivity were taught. RESULTS:
There was a significant effect between changes in coach MVPA and player MVPA
(unstandardised regression coefficient [B] = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.14 to 0.38) which
coincided with a significant indirect effect (B = 1.80, 95% CI = 0.85 to 2.85).
There was also a significant effect between changes in coach inactivity and player
inactivity (B = -0.23, 95% CI = -0.14 to -0.31), which coincided with a significant
indirect effect (B = -3.20, 95% CI = -0.14 to -0.31). No significant indirect
effects were found for lesson context and coaches' behaviours variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Coaches' MVPA and inactivity significantly mediated the effect of the
intervention on player MVPA and inactivity, respectively. Consequently, coaches'
physical activity levels appear to be important for influencing their players'
physical activity levels.

18972249	The moral disengagement in sport scale--short.	"A scale has recently been developed to measure moral disengagement in sport (Boardley & Kavussanu, 2007). It consists of 32 items that measure the eight
mechanisms of moral disengagement proposed by Bandura (1991). In the present study,
we aimed to: (a) examine whether a subset of these items could form a short version
of the scale; (b) provide evidence for the construct validity of the short version;
and (c) test its measurement invariance across sex and sport type. A total of 992
football, rugby, hockey, basketball, and netball players from three different
samples completed the long version of the scale. Data analyses indicated that the
short version of the scale consisted of eight items and had high internal
consistency. Construct validity of the scale was evidenced via correlations with
sport moral disengagement and prosocial and antisocial behaviour. Multisample
confirmatory factor analyses established measurement invariance across sex and
partial measurement invariance across four team sports. In conclusion, the short
version of the scale is a reliable and valid measure of moral disengagement in
sport.

substances) affects willingness to use illegal performance-enhancing substances. The
second was to examine whether attitudes, norms, and prototypes influence the

illegal-is-effective heuristic was a significant predictor of willingness but was
not a significant predictor of intentions. Implications for future research and

best free throwers in the NBA (negative stereotype), or a neutral sports video
(control). Participants then shot a set of free throws, during which half the
participants were also videotaped (observer condition), whereas the other half were
not (no observer condition). Results demonstrated that positive stereotypes improved
free throw performance, but only in the no observer condition. Interestingly,
observer pressure interacted with the positive stereotype to lead to performance
decrements. In the negative stereotype condition, performance decrements were
observed both in the observer and no observer conditions.

7736259	[Effects of different types of training on torque/angular velocity relationship.	"The purpose of this study was to examine the alterations of the Torque/Angular Velocity relationship in knee extensor and flexor muscles due to a long-term
training programme. Thirty five young elite basketball players were tested before,
after 12 weeks of a common weight-lifting programme (including concentric and
eccentric actions) and after 24 weeks including only concentric (C-E/C group) or
concentric and eccentric actions (C-E/C-E group). After 12 weeks, significant
decrease in torque of knee extensor muscles was observed. In contrast, significant
increases in torque of knee flexor and shoulder flexor and extensor muscles were
noted. After 24 weeks, significant increases were noted in torque of all muscular
groups, for the C-E/C group but not for the C-E/C-E group. It is concluded that
training including concentric and eccentric actions have not the same effect on
agonist and antagonist muscular groups. The alternation of the contraction mode

25401268	"Believing in ""us"": exploring leaders' capacity to enhance team confidence and"	"The present study examined the impact of athlete leaders' perceived confidence on their teammates' confidence and performance. Male basketball players (N = 102)
participated in groups of 4. To manipulate leaders' team confidence, the appointed
athlete leader of each newly formed basketball team (a confederate) expressed either
high or low team confidence. The results revealed an effect of team confidence
contagion such that team members had greater team confidence when the leader
expressed high (rather than low) confidence in the team's success. Second, the
present study sought to explain the mechanisms through which this contagion occurs.
In line with the social identity approach to leadership, structural equation
modeling demonstrated that this effect was partially mediated by team members'
increased team identification. Third, findings indicated that when leaders expressed
high team confidence, team members' performance increased during the test, but when
leaders expressed low confidence, team members' performance decreased. Athlete
leaders thus have the capacity to shape team members' confidence--and hence their
performance--in both positive and negative ways. In particular, by showing that they
believe in ""our team,"" leaders are able not only to make ""us"" a psychological
reality, but also to transform ""us"" into an effective operational unit.

23562293	Kinetic and kinematic differences between first and second landings of a drop	"BACKGROUND: Though the first landing of drop vertical jump task is commonly used to assess biomechanical performance measures that are associated with anterior cruciate
ligament injury risk in athletes, the implications of the second landing in this
task have largely been ignored. We examined the first and second landings of a drop
vertical jump for differences in kinetic and kinematic behaviors at the hip and
knee. METHODS: A cohort of 239 adolescent female basketball athletes (age=13.6 (1.6)
years) completed drop vertical jump tasks from an initial height of 31 cm. A three
dimensional motion capture system recorded positional data while dual force
platforms recorded ground reaction forces for each trial. FINDINGS: The first
landing demonstrated greater hip adduction angle, knee abduction angle, and knee
abduction moment than the second landing (P-values<0.028). The second landing
demonstrated smaller flexion angles and moments at the hip and knee than the first
landing (P-values<0.035). The second landing also demonstrated greater side-to-side
asymmetry in hip and knee kinematics and kinetics for both the frontal and sagittal
planes (P-values<0.044). INTERPRETATION: The results have important implications for
the future use of the drop vertical jump as an assessment tool for anterior cruciate
ligament injury risk behaviors in adolescent female athletes. The second landing may
be a more rigorous task and provides a superior tool to evaluate sagittal plane risk
factors than the first landing, which may be better suited to evaluate frontal plane
risk factors.

19771289	Knee joint kinematics and kinetics during a lateral false-step maneuver.	"CONTEXT: Cutting maneuvers have been implicated as a mechanism of noncontact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in collegiate female basketball players.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate knee kinematics and kinetics during running when the width
of a single step, relative to the path of travel, was manipulated, a lateral
false-step maneuver. DESIGN: Crossover design. SETTING: University biomechanics
laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen female collegiate basketball
athletes (age = 19.7 +/- 1.1 years, height = 172.3 +/- 8.3 cm, mass = 71.8 +/- 8.7
kg). INTERVENTION(S): Three conditions: normal straight-ahead running, lateral false
step of width 20% of body height, and lateral false step of width 35% of body
height. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Peak angles and internal moments for knee flexion,
extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation. RESULTS:
Differences were noted among conditions in peak knee angles (flexion [P < .01],
extension [P = .02], abduction [P < .01], and internal rotation [P < .01]) and peak
internal knee moments (abduction [P < .01], adduction [P < .01], and internal
rotation [P = .03]). The lateral false step of width 35% of body height was
associated with larger peak flexion, abduction, and internal rotation angles and
larger peak abduction, adduction, and internal rotation moments than normal running.
Peak flexion and internal rotation angles were also larger for the lateral false
step of width 20% of body height than for normal running, whereas peak extension
angle was smaller. Peak internal rotation angle increased progressively with
increasing step width. CONCLUSIONS: Performing a lateral false-step maneuver
resulted in changes in knee kinematics and kinetics compared with normal running.
The differences observed for lateral false steps were consistent with proposed
mechanisms of ACL loading, suggesting that lateral false steps represent a hitherto
neglected mechanism of noncontact ACL injury.

21294010	Description of dynamic shared knowledge: an exploratory study during a competitive	"This exploratory case study describes the sharedness of knowledge within a basketball team (nine players) and how it changes during an official match. To
determine how knowledge is mobilised in an actual game situation, the data were
collected and processed following course-of-action theory (Theureau 2003). The
results were used to characterise the contents of the shared knowledge (i.e.
regarding teammate characteristics, team functioning, opponent characteristics,
opposing team functioning and game conditions) and to identify the characteristic
types of change: (a) the reinforcement of a previous element of shared knowledge;
(b) the invalidation of an element of shared knowledge; (c) fragmentation of an
element of shared knowledge; (d) the creation of a new element of shared knowledge.
The discussion deals with the diverse types of change in shared knowledge and the
heterogeneous and dynamic nature of common ground within the team. STATEMENT OF
RELEVANCE: The present case study focused on how the cognitions of individual
members of a team coordinate to produce a team performance (e.g. surgical teams in
hospitals, military teams) and how the shared knowledge changes during team
activity. Traditional methods to increase knowledge sharedness can be enhanced by
making use of 'opportunities for coordination' to optimise team adaptiveness.

of basketball skills of different complexity. Three groups (n = 26) of children
followed the practice methods and the performance (result), and technique of simple
and complex basketball skills (dribble, pass, shoot, and lay-up) were assessed for
their effectiveness. Subjects practiced using four exercises for each skill, three
times a week, for eight weeks. A performance and a retention test (two weeks later)
were conducted. A multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measures on the
last factor indicated that knowledge of performance with results of goal-setting
significantly improved the techniques of the more complex skills but it was
significantly better than the knowledge of results and goal-setting method for
passing. Giving knowledge of results and setting goals improved performance and
proved to be better than the knowledge of performance method. Finally, the combined
method was as good as the knowledge of performance and as good as the knowledge of
results plus goal setting in performance but improvement was delayed mostly for the
more complex skills. Attentional needs for the analysis of information given
determined the success in skills execution and the effectiveness of the methods. The
different content of the information given to the athletes may improve different

aged 14-24 years from two sports clubs in the county of Aarhus, Denmark. The
athletes answered a questionnaire about occupation and sports activity. One-leg
standing balance was measured as the maximum time of one-legged balancing. The mean
of the maximum time of one-legged balancing was 29 s (interquartile range 11.25-33.5
s). One-leg standing balance was positively associated with years of participation
in basketball and was not associated with sex and age. We conclude that
participation in basketball may induce significantly adaptive effects on standing
balance.

19798997	Analogy learning and the performance of motor skills under pressure.	"The efficacy of analogical instruction, relative to explicit instruction, for the acquisition of a complex motor skill and subsequent performance under pressure was
investigated using a modified (seated) basketball shooting task. Differences in
attentional resource allocation associated with analogy and explicit learning were
also examined using probe reaction times (PRT). Access to task-relevant explicit
(declarative) knowledge was assessed. The analogy and explicit learning groups
performed equally well during learning and delayed retention tests. The explicit
group experienced a drop in performance during a pressured transfer test, relative
to their performance during a preceding retention test. However, the analogy group's
performance was unaffected by the pressure manipulation. Results from PRTs suggested
that both groups allocated equal amounts of attentional resources to the task
throughout learning and test trials. Analogy learners had significantly less access
to rules about the mechanics of their movements, relative to explicit learners. The
results are interpreted in the context of Eysenck and Calvo's (1992) processing
efficiency theory and Masters's (1992) theory of reinvestment.

22592541	The effect of wheel size on mobility performance in wheelchair athletes.	"The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of different wheel sizes, with fixed gear ratios, on maximal effort mobility performance in wheelchair
athletes. 13 highly trained wheelchair basketball players, grouped by classification
level, performed a battery of 3 field tests in an adjustable wheelchair with 3
different wheel sizes (0.59 m, 0.61 m and 0.65 m). Performance was assessed using
the time taken to perform drills, with velocity and acceleration data also collected
via a wheelchair velocometer. 20 m sprint time improved in the 0.65 m condition
(5.58 ± 0.43 s, P=0.029) compared with 0.59 m (5.72 ± 0.40 s). Acceleration
performance over the first 2 (P=0.299) and 3 (P=0.145) pushes was not statistically
influenced by wheel size. However, the peak velocities reached were greater in the
0.65 m condition (4.77 ± 0.46 m ∙ s(-1), P=0.078, Effect Size [ES]=0.63) compared
with 0.59 m (4.61 ± 0.40 m ∙ s(-1)). Impact velocity, calculated as the change in
velocity from the onset of a push to the following impact peak, to define coupling
performance, was also significantly improved in 0.65 m wheels (0.14 ± 0.14 m ∙
s(-1), P=0.006) than 0.59 m wheels (0.05 ± 0.10 m ∙ s(-1)). The time taken to
complete the linear mobility (P=0.630) and the agility drill (P=0.505) were not
affected by wheel size. Finally, no significant interactions existed between wheel
size, classification and any performance measure. To conclude, larger 0.65 m wheels
improved the maximal sprinting performance of highly trained wheelchair basketball
players, without any negative effects on acceleration or manoeuvrability.
Improvements in sprinting were attributed to a combination of the reduced drag
forces experienced and improvements in coupling thought to be due to the lower
angular velocities of the wheel/hand-rim when developing high wheelchair velocities
in larger wheels.

17901341	Anterior cruciate ligament injury in female and male athletes: the relationship	"BACKGROUND: It has been shown that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are more prevalent in female athletes than in male athletes. Soccer and basketball are
considered high-risk sports for ACL injury in female athletes. Several studies have
reported a relationship between ACL injury and measures of foot structure. This
study was conducted to investigate the relationship between foot structure and ACL
injury rates in female and male soccer and basketball players. METHODS: One hundred
five soccer and basketball players (53 women and 52 men) were recruited and divided
into an ACL-normal group (n=89) and an ACL-injured group (n=16). Two measures of
foot structure (subtalar joint neutral position and navicular drop test values) were
recorded for each subject. An independent t test and a paired t test were used to
analyze differences in ACL status, foot structure, and sex. A chi2 analysis
determined whether the prevalence of ACL injury was independent of sport. RESULTS:
No statistically significant differences were found in the foot structure measures
between women and men. Female soccer and basketball players had an ACL injury rate
seven times that of male players. CONCLUSIONS: Values derived from subtalar joint
neutral position measurement and the navicular drop test were not associated with
ACL injury in collegiate female and male soccer and basketball players.

18630653	Vicarious intergroup contact and the role of authorities in prejudice reduction.	"The present study focuses on the effect of vicarious intergroup contact and the support of an authority figure on the improvement of outgroup and meta-stereotype
evaluations. Meta-stereotype refers to the shared beliefs of ingroup members about
how they consider outgroup members to perceive their group. Three preliminary
studies were carried out to determine desirable and undesirable characteristics for
a good basketball performance, the task that best demonstrates the application of
these characteristics, and the two groups (basketball teams) that should be involved
in the vicarious intergroup contact. Fans of one of the basketball teams
participated in the current study. Vicarious intergroup contact improved outgroup
and meta-stereotype evaluations as compared with a no contact condition. In
addition, the positive effects of vicarious intergroup contact significantly
increased when it was supported by an authority figure. More importantly, our study
also shows that the improvement of outgroup evaluation was partially mediated by
changes on meta-stereotypes.

that symmetry is positively associated with height, body mass and physical
performance. In this study, symmetry was measured in adult male athletes from two
sports, competing at two different standards. Fifty-two elite and sub-elite
Australian male basketballers and soccer players, who regularly competed in the
national and state leagues in the 2000-2001 season, participated in the study. All
participants underwent anthropometric assessment. Both basketballers and national
league athletes in general were significantly taller (P < 0.0001) and heavier (P <
0.001) (and more ectomorphic in the case of basketballers) than their soccer-playing
and state league counterparts, respectively. The anthropometric traits were examined
further for departures from perfect bilateral symmetry. No significant differences
in size-corrected asymmetry were observed between the two competitive standards (P >
0.50), the two sports (P > 0.50) or among any of the competitive standard x sport
groups (P > 0.50). Contrary to expectations, we did not find any differences in
asymmetry between adult male athletes from two sports (basketball and soccer),
competing at two different standards (professional national league and
semi-professional state league).

from the National Basketball Association (NBA) during the 2008-2009 regular season.
Consistent with hypotheses, early season touch predicted greater performance for
individuals as well as teams later in the season. Additional analyses confirmed that
touch predicted improved performance even after accounting for player status,
preseason expectations, and early season performance. Moreover, coded cooperative
behaviors between teammates explained the association between touch and team
performance. Discussion focused on the contributions touch makes to cooperative

21998630	The hot (invisible?) hand: can time sequence patterns of success/failure in sports	"The long lasting debate initiated by Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky in [Formula: see text] is revisited: does a ""hot hand"" phenomenon exist in sports? Hereby we come
back to one of the cases analyzed by the original study, but with a much larger data
set: all free throws taken during five regular seasons ([Formula: see text]) of the
National Basketball Association (NBA). Evidence supporting the existence of the ""hot
hand"" phenomenon is provided. However, while statistical traces of this phenomenon
are observed in the data, an open question still remains: are these non random
patterns a result of ""success breeds success"" and ""failure breeds failure""
mechanisms or simply ""better"" and ""worse"" periods? Although free throws data is not
adequate to answer this question in a definite way, we speculate based on it, that
the latter is the dominant cause behind the appearance of the ""hot hand"" phenomenon

8934848	Visual control when aiming at a far target.	"Gaze behavior of elite basketball athletes was determined as they performed 10 accurate and 10 inaccurate free throws (FTs) to a regulation basket wearing an eye
tracker that permitted normal accuracy. Experts (mean FT = 78%) differed
significantly from near experts (mean FT = 56%) in having a longer fixation on the
target combined with an earlier fixation offset during the shooting action. These
results, which depart from current models of near aiming, are tentatively explained
using a location-suppression hypothesis. During the early phases of the aiming
action, a fixation of long duration is needed on a specific target location. As the
aiming action is then performed, vision appears to be a liability and is suppressed.

23085969	Relationships among performance of lateral cutting maneuver from lateral sliding and	"Basketball players have to move laterally and quickly change their movement directions, especially during defensive moves. This study aimed to investigate how
frontal and sagittal plane hip movements relate to fastness and quickness of lateral
cutting maneuvers from sliding. Three-dimensional biomechanical data were obtained
for 28 female college basketball players while they performed lateral cutting
maneuvers using their left leg after 2 lateral sliding steps. The lateral cutting
index (LCIndex) expressing fastness and quickness of lateral cutting maneuvers, peak
hip abduction and extension velocities immediately before foot contact, hip
abduction and extension velocities at foot contact, peak horizontal ground reaction
force, frontal plane ground reaction force angle, and sacrum center of mass position
were calculated. Simple and stepwise regression analyses were conducted to predict
LCIndex. The former showed that greater maximum hip extension velocity (p = 0.03)
and lesser hip abduction velocity (p = 0.04) as well as smaller ground reaction
force angle (p = 0.001) and lower sacrum center of mass position (p = 0.001) at foot
contact led to better LCIndex. The latter showed that sacrum center of mass position
at foot contact and hip extension velocity explained 35.3% (p < 0.01) and 7.3% (p =
0.088) of variance in LCIndex, respectively. Our results did not suggest that hip
abductor function is important for lateral sliding moves, instead suggesting that
faster hip extension motions to kick the ground and lowering the body center of mass
are crucial for better lateral deceleration-acceleration motions.

15487295	Individual differences of action orientation for risktaking in sports.	"The goal of this article is to explain empirical risk-taking behavior in sports from an individual cognitive modeling perspective. A basketball task was used in which
participants viewed four video options that varied in the degree of associated risk.
The participants were independently classified by scores on the Questionnaire for
Assessing Prospective Action Orientation and State Orientation in Success, Failure,
and Planning Situations as action-oriented or state-oriented decision makers. The
results of the experiment show that action-oriented players shoot faster and more
often to the basket and that state-oriented players prefer to pass to a playmaker
more often. Four versions of a computational model of decision making, Decision
Field Theory, were compared to evaluate whether behavioral differences depend on the
focus of attention, the initial preferences, threshold values, or an
approach-avoidance interpretation of the task. Different starting preferences
explained individual choices and decision times most accurately. Risk taking in
basketball shooting behavior can be best explained by different preferences for
starting values for risky and safe options caused by different levels of action
orientation.

acute effects of different PE lessons on after-school fitness performance in young
athletes. Twenty athletes (14-18 years) participated in 3 different PE lessons that
consisted of aerobic exercise (AE), resistance training (RT), or basketball skill
training (BS). Fitness performance was assessed after-school following each lesson

18059994	Ankle injuries among United States high school sports athletes, 2005-2006.	"CONTEXT: Ankle injuries are the most common sport-related injuries. To date, no studies have been published that use national data to present a cross-sport,
cross-sex analysis of ankle injuries among US high school athletes. OBJECTIVE: To
investigate the incidence rates of ankle injuries by sex, type of exposure, and
sport. DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiologic study. SETTING: One hundred US high
schools. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: United States high school athletes. MAIN
OUTCOME MEASURE(S): We reviewed ankle injury data collected over the 2005-2006
school year from a nationally representative sample obtained by High School RIO, an
injury surveillance system. Specific sports studied were boys' football, boys' and
girls' soccer, girls' volleyball, boys' and girls' basketball, boys' wrestling,
boys' baseball, and girls' softball. RESULTS: An estimated 326 396 ankle injuries
occurred nationally in 2005-2006, yielding an injury rate of 5.23 ankle injuries per
10 000 athlete-exposures. Ankle injuries occurred at a significantly higher rate
during competition (9.35 per 10 000 athlete-exposures) than during practice (3.63)
(risk ratio = 2.58; 95% confidence interval = 2.26, 2.94; P < .001). Boys'
basketball had the highest rate of ankle injury (7.74 per 10 000 athlete-exposures),
followed by girls' basketball (6.93) and boys' football (6.52). In all sports except
girls' volleyball, rates of ankle injury were higher in competition than in
practice. Overall, most ankle injuries were diagnosed as ligament sprains with
incomplete tears (83.4%). Ankle injuries most commonly caused athletes to miss less
than 7 days of activity (51.7%), followed by 7 to 21 days of activity loss (33.9%)
and more than 22 days of activity loss (10.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Sports that combine
jumping in close proximity to other players and swift changes of direction while
running are most often associated with ankle injuries. Future research on ankle
injuries is needed to drive the development and implementation of more effective
preventive interventions.

emotional responses of basketball fans as they exited the sport arena after their
team had won or lost an official game. Half of the fans were given the opportunity
to increase or decrease their association with the team before the measures of
self-esteem and emotions; the remaining fans were given the opportunity after the
measures. The fans tended to associate more with the team after team success than
after team failure. In addition, self-esteem and positive emotions were higher, and
negative emotions lower, when measured after, rather than before, the opportunity to
increase or decrease association with the team. Those effects were more pronounced
among high-team-identification fans than among low-team-identification fans. The
results suggest a distinction between the short- and long-term effects of game
outcome on the willingness to associate with one's team. In the short term,
willingness to associate with the team may oscillate in accordance with team
performance, even among high-team-identification fans; in the long term, only
high-team-identification fans may maintain their allegiance to the team.

SoccerSmart, as part of their coach education programmes. A small-size descriptive
study was conducted in both sports, to assess the efficacy of integrating sports
injury prevention into coach education. NetballSmart was evaluated at the end of
2005, via a telephone survey of 217 coaches (53% response rate) who had attended a
NetballSmart course earlier in the year. SoccerSmart was evaluated at the start of
2007, via an Internet questionnaire completed by 71 coaches (20% response rate) who
had attended a SoccerSmart course in 2006. The evaluations focused on the quality
and use of the course resource material, as well as assessing the extent to which
coaches had incorporated injury prevention behaviours into player practices. After
attending a NetballSmart course, 89% of coaches changed the way they coached, with
95% reported using knowledge from the course and passing it on to players.
Ninety-six percent of football/soccer coaches also changed the way they coached,
with most change relating to warm-up/cool-down and stretch (65%), technique (63%),
fitness (60%) and nutrition/hydration (58%) practices. Although this was a
descriptive study in nature, with a small sample size, we conclude that integration
of injury prevention content within coach education courses and resources may be a
viable and effective strategy to help community coaches--and therefore community
players--help reduce their risk of injury.

athletes. The purpose of this study was to employ sensitive laboratory (lab-based)
tools to determine predictive mechanisms that underlie increased KAM during landing.
METHODS: Female basketball and soccer players (N=744) from a single county public
school district were recruited to participate in testing of anthropometrics,
maturation, laxity/flexibility, strength and landing biomechanics. Linear regression
was used to model KAM, and logistic regression was used to examine high (>25.25 Nm
of KAM) versus low KAM as surrogate for ACL injury risk. RESULTS: The most
parsimonious model included independent predictors (β±1 SE) (1) peak knee abduction
angle (1.78±0.05; p<0.001), (2) peak knee extensor moment (0.17±0.01; p<0.001), (3)
knee flexion range of motion (0.15±0.03; p<0.01), (4) body mass index (BMI) Z-score
(-1.67±0.36; p<0.001) and (5) tibia length (-0.50±0.14; p<0.001) and accounted for
78% of the variance in KAM during landing. The logistic regression model that
employed these same variables predicted high KAM status with 85% sensitivity and 93%
specificity and a C-statistic of 0.96. CONCLUSIONS: Increased knee abduction angle,
quadriceps recruitment, tibia length and BMI with decreased knee flexion account for
80% of the measured variance in KAM during a drop vertical jump. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:
Females who demonstrate increased KAM are more responsive and more likely to benefit
from neuromuscular training. These findings should significantly enhance the
identification of those at increased risk and facilitate neuromuscular training
targeted to this important risk factor (high KAM) for ACL injury.

21162362	Effect of attending to a ball during a side-cut maneuver on lower extremity	"Many sports associated with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury require athletes attend to a ball during participation. We investigated effects of attending to a
ball on lower extremity mechanics during a side-cut maneuver and if these effects
are consistent for males and females. Sagittal and frontal plane hip and knee
kinematics and joint moments were measured during side-cut maneuvers in 19 male and
19 female National Collegiate Athletic Association division III basketball players.
Participants also experienced two side-cut conditions that required attention to a
ball. Our results did not indicate that the effect of attention varies with gender.
However, during side-cut conditions while attending to a ball, internal knee
adductor moment was 20% greater (p = 0.03) and peak knee flexion angle was 4 degrees
larger (p < 0.01). Females demonstrated 5 degrees less hip flexion (p = 0.046), 12
degrees less knee flexion (p < 0.01), and 4 degrees more knee abduction (p = 0.026)
at initial contact during all side-cut conditions than males. Attention to a ball
may affect lower extremity mechanics relevant to ACL injury. The validity of
laboratory studies of lower extremity mechanics for sports that include attention to
a ball may be increased if participants are required to attend to a ball during the
task.

to investigate the landings that were least stressful on the body. Eighteen State or
Under 21 netball players participated as subjects. The subjects performed five
different landing conditions at two pass heights. The five landing conditions were
three legal landings consisting of a pivot, a run-on and a two foot landing. The
other two landings used an extra step technique for the pivot and run-on landings.
Data were collected using two force plates. The data were analysed using an ANCOVA,
with approach speed as the covariate. The range of values for peak vertical ground
reaction force were from 3.53 to 5.74 BW and for peak braking force the range was
from 0.83 to 1.75 BW. No significant differences were found between each respective
legal and extra step techniques. The run-on techniques exhibited lower peak forces,
longer attenuation times and lower loading rates than the pivot or two foot landing
conditions. The data clearly showed that there were no advantages to be gained from
taking an extra step for either the pivot or run-on landing techniques. The run-on
technique of landing appears to be most beneficial to reducing loads on the lower
limb. A change to the footwork rules cannot be recommended based on the results of

undertook bench press training with 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks, using equal
volume programs (24 repetitions x 80-105% 6RM in 13 minutes 20 seconds). Subjects
were assigned to one of two experimental groups designed either to elicit repetition
failure with 4 sets of 6 repetitions every 260 seconds (RF(4 x 6)) or allow all
repetitions to be completed with 8 sets of 3 repetitions every 113 seconds (NF(8 x
3)). The RF(4 x 6) treatment elicited substantial increases in strength (7.3 +/- 2.4
kg, +9.5%, p < 0.001) and power (40.8 +/- 24.1 W, +10.6%, p < 0.001), while the NF(8
x 3) group elicited 3.6 +/- 3.0 kg (+5.0%, p < 0.005) and 25 +/- 19.0 W increases
(+6.8%, p < 0.001). The improvements in the RF(4 x 6) group were greater than those
in the repetition rest group for both strength (p < 0.005) and power (p < 0.05).
Bench press training that leads to repetition failure induces greater strength gains
than nonfailure training in the bench press exercise for elite junior team sport
athletes.

8941910	Stress and performance: an application of Gray's three-factor arousal theory to	"The suitability of Gray's (1975) three-factor arousal theory as a model of human performance under stress was investigated in a study of basketball free-throw
shooting. Free-throw attempts, made by members of an NCAA Division I men's varsity
team, were videotaped during one full season. On the basis of Gray's theory, we
predicted that increased stress (assumed to be present in games as opposed to
practices) would be associated with longer pre-shot preparations and a greater
incidence of overthrow shots. The prediction was confirmed by the results. Moreover,
we found that free-throws were more frequently overthrown when attempted during
crucial rather than non-crucial game situations. Further tests of the utility of
Gray's theory are suggested.

16089180	Disconnects between popular discourse and home advantage research: what can fans and	"Many of the factors identified as influencing the home advantage have an underlying social basis, presumably through the influence exerted by the home crowd. Beliefs in
the home advantage and the causes of that advantage also have a social basis: sports
coverage and fan discourse focus on some aspects of the phenomenon at the expense of
others. This paper compares home advantage research with the use of the concept in
media narratives and fan Intemet postings. While there are many similarities across
sources, the findings suggest three major differences. Fans, and to a lesser extent
the media, (1) focus almost exclusively on winning as the evidence for a home
advantage, (2) see crowd noise as the main factor for the home advantage, and (3)
treat the phenomenon as much more transient than is suggested by academic studies. I
identify several features of the phenomenon that facilitate popular views of the
home advantage and suggest how future research may benefit from incorporating those
views.

significant. Results indicated that altering the movements in the routine had a
significant effect on performance while lengthening the time did not.

basketball and soccer players. DESIGN: Randomized, retrospective. PARTICIPANTS:
Women's and men's basketball and soccer players at NCAA Division I, II, and III
institutions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Athletes with or without ACL injury. RESULTS:
There was no relationship of ACL injury rate to NCAA division level in men's or
women's basketball or soccer. CONCLUSIONS: There are many different variables that
contribute to a player's skill level. Although these variables may relate to ACL
injury and may be responsible for the differential in injury rate between men and
women, skill level as represented by collegiate division does not relate to ACL
injury. When considering possible etiologies of the differential in ACL injury rates
between men and women, the use of the term ""skill"" should be avoided, and more
specific terms used.

8668427	Effect of complexity of a physical task on estimation of time to complete.	"Two studies were performed to examine the effect of the complexity of a physical task on the estimation of the time required for its performance. Different paradigms
for the estimation of time (prospective vs retrospective) were used with different
methods of estimation (reproduction vs verbal estimation). In Study 1, 32 pairs of
adults were asked to throw a ball to each other in different ways. The two groups
were distinguished by the motor and cognitive changes required in moving from one
task to the next. One group had to perform 10 successive repetitions on each of five
kinds of ball throws, while the other had to perform the same number of ball throws
but with each type being split into two different successive sets of throws so here
the task consisted of changes. In Study 2, 60 children (aged 7 or 8 yr.) were asked
to perform a set of basketball tasks. The two groups were distinguished by the pace
at which they had to perform the task, slowly or rapidly. The results of the two
studies indicated a negative relation between the complexity of the task and the
group's estimation of time. The reproductive method yielded shorter estimations than
the verbal method. The results indicate that for physical activity the attentional
model may well be valid.

behavior in that setting. The purpose of this study was to determine the
relationship of a task and ego goal orientation (i.e., the tendency to focus on
personal mastery or beating others, respectively) to sportsmanship attitudes and
perceptions of the legitimacy of aggressive acts by testing this assumption in the
context of interscholastic sport. Fifty-six male and 67 female high school
basketball players completed a three-part questionnaire assessing (a) individual
differences in goal orientation, (b) approval of ""unsportsmanlike play/cheating,""
""strategic play,"" and ""sportsmanship behaviors,"" and (c) subjective ratings of the
legitimacy of intentionally injurious behaviors. All measures were
basketball-specific. Results indicated a low task orientation and high ego
orientation corresponded to an endorsement of unsportsmanlike play/cheating. Ego
orientation positively related to the rating of aggressive acts as more legitimate.
Gender differences in goal orientation, sportsmanship attitudes, and legitimacy
ratings were observed.

10751003	Using bone's adaptation ability to lower the incidence of stress fractures.	"In three prospective epidemiologic studies of the effect of pre-military-induction sport activities on the incidence of lower extremity stress fractures during
infantry basic training, recruits who played ball sports (principally basketball)
regularly for at least 2 years before basic training had a significantly lower
incidence of stress fractures (13.2%, 16.7%, and 3.6% in the three studies,
respectively) than recruits who did not play ball sports (28.9%, 27%, and 18.8%,
respectively). Preinduction running was not related to the incidence of stress
fracture. To assess the tibial strain environment during these sport activities, we
made in vivo strain measurements on three male volunteers from the research team.
Peak tibial compression and tension strain and strain rates during basketball
reached levels 2 to 5.5 times higher than during walking and about 10% to 50% higher
than during running. The high bone strain and strain rates that occurred in recruits
while playing basketball in the years before military induction may have increased
their bone stiffness, according to Wolff's Law. The stiffer bone could tolerate
higher stresses better, resulting in lower strains for a given activity and a lower
incidence of stress fractures during basic training.

22843107	Girls' physical activity levels during organized sports in Australia.	"PURPOSE: The primary aim of this study was to objectively examine the physical activity (PA) levels of girls during organized sports (OS) and to compare the levels
between games and practices for the same participants. The secondary aims of this
study were to document lesson context and coach behavior during practices and games.
METHODS: Participants were 94 girls recruited from 10 teams in three OS (netball,
basketball, and soccer) from the western suburbs of Sydney. Each participant wore an
ActiGraph GT3X monitor for the duration of one practice and one game. The System for
Observing Fitness Instruction Time was concurrently used to document lesson context
and coach behavior. RESULTS: Girls spent a significantly higher percentage of time
in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) during practices compared with games (33.8% vs
30.6%; t = 2.94, P < 0.05). Girls spent approximately 20 min·h(-1) in MVPA during
practices and approximately 18 min·h(-1) in MVPA during games. An average of 2957
and 2702 steps per hour were accumulated during practices and games, respectively.
However, girls spent roughly two-thirds of their OS time in light PA or sedentary.
On the basis of the System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time findings, coaches
spent a large proportion of practice time in management (15.0%) and knowledge
delivery (18.5%). An average of 13.0 and 15.8 occurrences per hour were observed
during games and practices where coaches promoted PA. CONCLUSIONS: For every hour of
game play or practice time, girls accumulated approximately one third of the
recommended 60 min of MVPA time and approximately one quarter of the 12,000 steps
that girls are recommended to accumulate daily. For this population, OS seems to
make a substantial contribution to the recommended amounts of MVPA and steps for
participating girls. OS alone, however, does not provide amounts of PA sufficient to
meet daily recommendations for adolescent girls.

9298552	Somatotype in high performance female netball players may influence player position	"AIMS: To investigate the relation between somatotype, performance characteristics, and the incidence of injury during the Australian Netball Championships. METHOD: Two
hundred and forty high performance netball players competed at the Australian
Netball Championships in which 213 (89%) were measured using the Heath-Carter
somatotype scale. During these championships, in conjunction with the injury
assessments, data analysis included a three factor analysis of variance (level of
competition, playing position, and injury) for the dependent somatotype variables
(endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectopmorphy), and the level of significance was set at
0.05. RESULTS: For the three dependent somatotype variables, there were no main
effects between endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy), and the level of
significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS: For the three dependent somatotype variables,
there were no main effects between endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy and the
incidence of injury. However, for the mesomorphy and ectomorphy variables,
significant main effects for the playing position were found. No main effects
existed between the somatotype variables and levels of competition. CONCLUSION: The
somatotype variables did not influence the incidence of injury, but mesomorphy and
ectomorphy did influence the different playing positions.

to self-report their cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety and self-confidence as a
single response on several occasions immediately before going on court to play.
Performance was video-recorded and aspects of performance that could be
characterized as requiring either largely anaerobic power (height jumped) or working
memory (successful passes and assists) were measured. Intra-individual performance
scores were computed from these measures and the data from seven matches were
subjected to regression analyses and then hierarchical regression analyses. The
results indicated that, as anticipated, somatic anxiety positively predicted
performance that involved anaerobic demands. Self-confidence, and not cognitive
anxiety, was the main predictor of performance scores with working memory demands.
It would appear that different competitive state responses exert differential
effects upon aspects of actual performance. Identifying these differences will be
valuable in recommending intervention strategies designed to facilitate performance.

indication in young sportsmen with recurrent posterior elbow impingement. A
professional javelin thrower and a basketball player with recurrent loose bodies,

acids was assessed, as well as the urinary excretion of urea and creatinine.
Simultaneously, we have studied 82 women who did not underwent physical activity
(control group). After a 7-days long recall, by means of the food weighing method,
was assessed by a computerized program the daily average intake of: total energy,
macronutrients, proteins of animal origin and essential amino acids. The
determination of urinary urea and creatinine was made in a 24-hours sample. The
protein intake was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in basketball and handball
players and in the runners than in the control group. The protein intake related
with the body weight (g/kg) was significantly higher in basketball players (p <
0.05) and in the runners (p < 0.01), taking both the sportswomen and the sedentary
women quantities higher than 0.8 g/kg/day established as minimum allowances. The
amino acids intake related with the body weight (mg/kg), exceeded widely in all the
studied groups the minimum recommended for each of them, outstanding the values
significantly high (p < 0,01) found for all the amino acids in the runners. Both for
the urinary excretion of the urea and the creatinine, the highest values correspond
to the runners. All the sportswomen have superior protein and essential amino acids
intake in relation with women without physical activity. The higher body losses of
nitrogen in the form of urea and creatinine found in the runners are due to their
higher protein/kg of body weight intake.
